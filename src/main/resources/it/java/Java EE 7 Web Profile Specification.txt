Bes requirem Such re the Java 3.x tech “plain” aims at develop.
Inevitably, the number of technologies used to create even simple lications had grown by leaps and bounds.
By incorporating many of these APIs, the Web Profile raising the bar for what should be considered a basic stack for the ment of web applications using the Java platform.
Furthermore, this stack be easy to grow, so as to address any remaining developer needs.
Against this drive towards completeness, one wishes to balance a desire to limit the footprint of web containers, both in physical and in conceptual terms.
From the point of view of developers learning the Web Profile, it is more valuable to have a small, focused profile, with as little overlap between technologies as possible APIs.

It also relies on the pluggability features in the specification to allow applications to use libraries that extend the servlet er with minimal configuration overhead.
It is conceivable that products will hoice at installation time between different configurations, some richer in ns, or even allow for complete customization beyond the required core.
Being the first profile ava EE 6 Platform to be defined, we expect the Web Profile specification ed as a model for future profiles.
It will also be seen as a starting point for anding how the requirements defined in the Java EE Platform specification a profile that subsets the platform itself, a significant innovation in this.
The case of a profile that is a superset of the platform is asier to picture.
To help with this process, this section attempts to shed how one should go from the definition of the Web Profile to figuring out.
As dictated by the general rules for Java EE profiles in the Platform specific.
The Profile follow a specific Platform requirem must im Platform compon.
As Java M the Web implem requirem other ha ation, products that implement the Web Profile must honor: equirements of the Java EE Platform specification that apply to all profiles;
For example, Web Profile s must implement the Servlet API, which in turn means they need to ll the requirements listed in the Servlet specification.
As a first example, since a Web product is required to implement the Servlet technology, it must also ll general requirements for Java EE web containers in the Platform ation.
Additionally, it must follow all security requirements in the specification that pertain to Java EE web containers, all interoperability ents for such containers, etc.
Since it is not a required component of Profile, Web Profile products are not required to include an entation of JMS, nor do they have to support other JMS-related.
On the nd, a Web Profile product that included an implementation of JMS would.
Particular care should be taken when determining applicable requirements based on the presence of EJB Lite in the Web Profile.

When examining an EJBrequirement in the Java EE Platform spec, one must first of all determine PI classes, component types and EJB container services are mentioned in irement itself.
Only if all of them fall inside the EJB Lite subset that ent is considered applicable to Web Profile products.
