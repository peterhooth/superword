1
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:02,414
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

2
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:04,708
Tell them we wish to board at once.

3
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,627
With all due respect...

4
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:10,964
the ambassadors for the supreme chancellor
wish to board immediately.

5
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,966
Yes, of course.

6
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,177
As you know,
our blockade is perfectly legal...

7
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:20,390
and we'd be happy to
receive the ambassadors.

8
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,498
I'm TC-14 at your service.

9
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,500
This way, please.

10
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:56,676
We are greatly honored
by your visit, Ambassadors.

11
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:58,678
Make yourselves comfortable.

12
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:01,139
My master will be with you shortly.

13
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:07,312
I have a bad feeling about this.

14
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:10,440
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

15
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:14,486
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

16
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,988
Don't center on your anxieties, Obi-Wan.

17
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:20,241
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

18
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:23,203
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

19
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,330
But not at the expense of the moment.

20
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,374
Be mindful of the living
Force, young Padawan.

21
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,418
Yes, Master.

22
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:36,257
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

23
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:38,510
These Federation types are cowards.

24
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:41,471
The negotiations will be short.

25
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,849
What? What did you say?

26
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:47,977
The ambassadors are Jedi
knights, I believe.

27
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:49,938
I knew it.

28
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:52,315
They're here to force a settlement.

29
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:56,736
Distract them. I will contact Lord Sidious.

30
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:58,446
Are you brain-dead?

31
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:01,407
I'm not going in there with two Jedi.

32
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,494
Send a droid.

33
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,793
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

34
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,254
No. I sense an unusual amount of fear...

35
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,506
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

36
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:29,310
What is it?

37
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:32,063
This scheme of yours has
failed, Lord Sidious.

38
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:35,733
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

39
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:40,697
Viceroy, I don't want
this stunted slime in my sight again.

40
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:46,077
This turn of events is unfortunate.
We must accelerate our plans.

41
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:48,788
Begin landing your troops.

42
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:52,625
My lord, is that legal?

43
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,044
I will make it legal.

44
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,463
And the Jedi?

45
00:04:57,548 --> 00:05:00,091
The chancellor should never have
brought them into this.

46
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:01,968
Kill them immediately.

47
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:06,389
Yes, my lord. As you wish.

48
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:10,059
Captain, look!

49
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,562
Shields up!

50
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:17,901
Sorry.

51
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:21,571
Dioxis.

52
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,037
They must be dead by now.

53
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,831
Destroy what's left of them.

54
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,342
Excuse me.

55
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:45,428
- Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
- Roger, roger.

56
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:48,056
Uh-oh. Blast them.

57
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,355
What is going on down there?

58
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,440
We lost the transmission, sir.

59
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,948
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

60
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:08,034
Well, no, but I don't...
Seal off the bridge.

61
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,828
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

62
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:12,914
I want droidekas up here at once!

63
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,625
We will not survive this.

64
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,596
Close the blast doors!

65
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,355
That will hold them.

66
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:48,574
They are still coming through.

67
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,618
This is impossible!

68
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,959
Where are those droidekas?

69
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,296
Master! Destroyers!

70
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:09,053
They have shield generators!

71
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:13,224
It's a standoff. Let's go.

72
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,939
They're no match for droidekas.

73
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:21,733
Sir!

74
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,527
They've gone up the ventilation shaft.

75
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,997
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

76
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,376
This is an odd play for
the Trade Federation.

77
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:43,629
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

78
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,298
Let's split up.

79
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,634
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

80
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,553
You were right about one thing, Master.

81
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,224
The negotiations were short.

82
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:58,811
Sir, a transmission from the planet.

83
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:01,022
It's Queen Amidala herself.

84
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,566
At last we are getting results.

85
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,945
Again you come before us, Your Highness.

86
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,157
You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.

87
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,994
Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.

88
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,663
I was not aware of such failure.

89
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:20,500
I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...

90
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,336
and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.

91
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,713
I know nothing of any ambassadors.

92
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:28,216
You must be mistaken.

93
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,343
Beware, Viceroy.

94
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,137
The Federation has gone too far this time.

95
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:37,308
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

96
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:39,977
You assume too much.

97
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:41,479
We will see.

98
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:47,068
- She's right. The senate will never...
- It's too late now.

99
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,154
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

100
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:54,659
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

101
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:03,918
Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?

102
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,212
How could that be true?

103
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:10,675
I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.

104
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,554
It must... handiwork...
negotiate... ambassadors...

105
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:17,306
- nobody would...
- Senator Palpatine.

106
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,308
What's happening?

107
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,310
Check the transmission generator.

108
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:26,274
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

109
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,693
The Federation would not dare go that far.

110
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:32,613
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be finished.

111
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:35,575
We must continue to rely on negotiation.

112
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,911
Negotiation? We've lost all communications.

113
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:41,372
And where are the chancellor's ambassadors?

114
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,168
This is a dangerous
situation, Your Highness.

115
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,378
Our security volunteers will be no match...

116
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:49,672
against a battle-hardened Federation army.

117
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:54,927
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

118
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,840
Yes, Viceroy?

119
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:36,719
Captain, we've searched the ship
and there is no trace of the Jedi.

120
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,597
They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.

121
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,183
If they're down here, sir, we'll find them.

122
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:46,646
Use caution.
These Jedi are not to be underestimated.

123
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,245
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

124
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,081
Get down!

125
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,969
Was'n dat? Hey, wait!

126
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,638
Oh, mooie-mooie, I love you.

127
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,807
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

128
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,559
I spake.

129
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,811
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

130
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,814
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

131
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,984
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

132
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,194
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.

133
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,197
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

134
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:40,241
- Oh, no!
- Stay down!

135
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,334
You saved my again.

136
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,336
- What's this?
- A local.

137
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:55,006
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

138
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,551
More? "More" did you spake?

139
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:03,514
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

140
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:06,851
Is where I grew up. 'Tis a hidden city.

141
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,354
- A city?
- Uh-huh.

142
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,273
Can you take us there?

143
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,609
On second thought, no.

144
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,236
- Not really, no.
- No?

145
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,488
'Tis embarrassing...

146
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:23,576
but my afraid my've been banished.

147
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,787
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.

148
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:29,957
Terrible tings to me if me goen back dare.

149
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:33,085
- You hear that?
- Yah.

150
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,964
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

151
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,675
If they find us, they will crush us...

152
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,347
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

153
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,351
Yousa point is well seen.

154
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,853
Dis way. Hurry!

155
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,445
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

156
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,072
Ah, my warning you.

157
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:05,701
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

158
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:09,163
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.

159
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:22,009
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?

160
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:10,224
So good bein home!

161
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:29,160
Hey, yousa. Stopa dare.

00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,662
Heyo-dales, Cap'n Tarpals.

Mesa back.

164
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,709
Noah gain, Jar Jar. Yousa goen tada bosses.

165
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,462
Yousa in big dudu dis time.

166

How wude.

167
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:57,897
Yousa cannot bees hair.

168
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:02,526
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

169
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:07,531
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

170
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:11,285
Wesa no like da Naboo.

171
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:14,163
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

172
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,208
Day tink day brains so big.

173
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:21,462
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.

174
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,923
Mesa no tink so.

175
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,884
Day not know of uss-en.

176
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,970
You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle.

177
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:33,474
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.

178
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:38,354
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

179
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,023
Then speed us on our way.

180
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,692
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

181
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,570
We could use a transport.

182
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:49,532
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

183
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,743
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

184
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:57,623
'tis goen through the planet core.

185
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,583
Now...

186
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,544
go.

187
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,879
Thank you for your help. We leave in peace.

188
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,090
Master, what's a bongo?

189
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,175
A transport, I hope.

190
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,344
Deysa setten yousa up.

191
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:14,139
Goen through da planet core? Bad bombin'.

192
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,394
Any help here would be hot.

193
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,605
Master, we're short on time.

194
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,401
We'll need a navigator to get us
through the planet's core.

195
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,444
This Gungan may be of help.

196
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:32,658
What is to become of Jar Jar Binks here?

197
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:37,705
Hisen to be pune-ished.

198
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:39,999
I saved his life.

199
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,585
He owes me what you call a "life-debt."

200
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:46,547
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

201
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,049
Binks...

202
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:53,137
yousa havena liveplay with thisen hisen?

203
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,729
Begone wit him!

204
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:06,775
Count me outta dis one.

205
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,029
Better dead here than dead in da core.

206
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:13,282
Yee gods! What mesa sayin?

207
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:34,303
Dis is nutsen. Oh, gooberfish!

208
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,640
- Why were you banished, Jar Jar?
- It's a longo tale-o...

209
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:42,811
buta a small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.

210
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:47,775
- You were banished for being clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

211
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:04,917
Mesa caused mabee one two-y
lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

212
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,086
Yud-say boom da gasser...

213
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,005
den crashin der boss's heyblibber,
den banished.

214
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:19,348
Big gooberfish! Huge-o teeth!

215
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:34,196
- There's always a bigger fish.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

216
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:48,794
The invasion is on schedule, my lord.

217
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,880
I have the senate bogged
down in procedures.

218
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:56,468
They will have no choice but
to accept your control of the system.

219
00:18:56,553 --> 00:19:01,265
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

220
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,393
Queen Amidala is young and naive.

221
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,938
You will find controlling her
will not be difficult.

222
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:09,982
Yes, my lord.

223
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,319
You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi.

224
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:18,949
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

225
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:27,166
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

226
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,085
Oh, maxi big, da Force.

227
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,963
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

228
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,759
- We're losing power.
- Oh, no!

229
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,975
Wesa dyin' here.

230
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,728
- Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet"?

231
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,856
Monsters out dare. Leak'n in here.

232
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,944
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

233
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,114
Power's back.

234
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,742
Monster's back!

235
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,335
Relax.

236
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,920
You overdid it.

237
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,730
Head for that outcropping.

238
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,774
Oh, boy.

239
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,145
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

240
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:13,981
Ah, victory.

241
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,663
Dis'n loverly.

242
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,172
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

243
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:42,467
The queen and I will sign a treaty
that will legitimize our occupation here.

244
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:45,762
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

245
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:49,349
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

246
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:53,562
In time, your people's suffering
will persuade you to see our point of view.

247
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:56,857
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

248
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,609
Process them.

249
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:00,527
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

250
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:02,279
Roger, roger.

251
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:59,378
We should leave the street, Your Highness.

252
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,129
Get their weapons.

253
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:05,217
Yousa guys bombad!

254
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:09,221
We're ambassadors for
the supreme chancellor.

255
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,223
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

256
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,141
The negotiations never took place.

257
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,644
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

258
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,896
They've knocked out all our communications.

259
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:21,358
- Do you have transports?
- In the main hangar. This way.

260
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:29,408
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

261
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:33,036
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

262
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:36,248
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

263
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,084
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

264
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,378
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

265
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,921
They can't afford to kill her.

266
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:45,173
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

267
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:47,259
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

268
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,303
My feelings tell me they will destroy you.

269
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:51,847
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.

270
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,391
Senator Palpatine will need your help.

271
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:58,520
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.

272
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,522
We are brave, Your Highness.

273
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,859
If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.

274
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,486
Then I will plead our case to the senate.

275
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,323
Be careful, Governor.

276
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,334
We'll need to free those pilots.

277
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,462
I'll deal with that.

278
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:27,966
Halt.

279
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,760
I'm ambassador to the supreme chancellor.

280
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:31,470
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

281
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:34,806
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

282
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:37,559
Coruscant? U h, that doesn't compute.

283
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,561
Uh, wait. U h, you're under arrest.

284
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,234
Come on. Move!

285
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:52,574
Go!

286
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:21,478
Now, stay here and keep out of trouble.

287
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:27,442
Hello, boyos.

288
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,409
There's the blockade.

289
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,462
The shield generator's been hit!

290
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,514
How wude!

291
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,151
We're losing droids fast.

292
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:12,612
If we can't get the shield generator fixed,
we'll be sitting ducks.

293
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:15,991
The shields are gone.

294
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,500
The power's back!

295
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:31,756
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

296
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:34,468
Deflector shields up at maximum.

297
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:47,731
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

298
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:50,734
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

299
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,028
Here, Master. Tatooine.

300
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,863
It's small, out of the way, poor.

301
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,740
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.

302
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,700
How can you be sure?

303
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,744
It's controlled by the Hutts.

304
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:03,705
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

305
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,124
- If they discovered her...
- It'd be no different than landing...

306
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:08,126
on a system controlled by the Federation...

307
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:10,337
except that the Hutts
aren't looking for her...

308
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,547
which gives us the advantage.

309
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:20,013
And Queen Amidala, has
she signed the treaty?

310
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:23,767
She has disappeared, my lord.

311
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:28,063
One Naboo cruiser got past the blockade.

312
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:31,149
I want that treaty signed.

313
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:33,276
My lord...

314
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:35,987
it's impossible to locate the ship.

315
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:38,281
It's out of our range.

316
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:40,659
Not for a Sith.

317
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:43,161
This is my apprentice...

318
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:45,163
Darth Maul.

319
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:49,793
He will find your lost ship.

320
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,424
This is getting out of hand.

321
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,593
Now there are two of them.

322
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:01,721
We should not have made this bargain.

323
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:10,564
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

324
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:13,567
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

325
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:17,070
It is to be commended. What is its number?

326
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:21,825
R2-D2, Your Highness.

327
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,410
Thank you, R2-D2.

328
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,582
Padmé.

329
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,252
Clean this droid up as best you can.

330
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,337
It deserves our gratitude.

331
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,674
Continue, Captain.

332
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:42,470
Your Highness, with your permission...

333
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:45,348
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

334
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:48,810
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

335
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,563
I do not agree with the Jedi on this.

336
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:54,566
You must trust my judgment, Your Highness.

337
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,696
Hello.

338
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,824
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

339
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,368
I'm Padmé.

340
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:08,496
Mesa Jar Jar Binks.

341
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,665
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

342
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:16,504
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

343
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:20,300
Mesa day starten pitty okeyday
witda brisky morning munchen.

344
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:23,219
Den boom! Getten berry scared...

Mesa getten berry, berry scared.

347
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:39,903
- That's it... Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

348
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:44,157
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

349
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:04,177
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

350
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,763
That'll complicate things. Be wary.

351
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:10,016
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.

352
00:30:10,101 --> 00:30:12,185
Don't let them send any transmissions.

353
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,694
The sun doen murder to mesa skin.

354
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:22,320
Wait!

355
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:24,823
Wait.

356
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:31,121
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

357
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:35,041
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

358
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:37,210
The spaceport is not going to be pleasant.

359
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,462
The queen wishes it.

360
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:41,548
She's curious about the planet.

361
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:47,137
This is not a good idea. Stay close to me.

362
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:03,778
Moisture farms, for the most part.

363
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:08,783
Some indigenous tribes and scavengers.

364
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:10,785
The few spaceports like this one...

365
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,204
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

366
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:15,248
Like us.

367
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:19,377
Dissen berry, berry bad.

368
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:22,464
Icky, icky goo!

369
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:37,896
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

370
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,487
Good day to you.

371
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,531
What do you want?

372
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:51,743
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

373
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:55,955
Ah, yes! Nubian. We have lots of that.

374
00:31:56,624 --> 00:31:58,541
Boy, get in here now!

375
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:00,543
My droid has a readout of what I need.

376
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,839
What took you so long?

377
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,050
I was cleaning the fan switches.

378
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,928
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

379
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:13,306
So, let me take thee out back, huh?

380
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,308
We'll find what you need.

381
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,521
Don't touch anything.

382
00:32:29,824 --> 00:32:32,784
- Are you an angel?
- What?

383
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:36,621
An angel. I heard the deep space pilots
talk about them.

384
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,624
They're the most beautiful creatures
in the universe.

385
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,335
They live on the moons of Iego, I think.

386
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:46,756
You're a funny little boy.
How do you know so much?

387
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:50,718
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

388
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:55,139
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

389
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:59,227
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

390
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,646
How long have you been here?

391
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,775
Since I was very little. Three, I think.

392
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,611
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt...

393
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:11,447
but she lost us betting on the Podraces.

394
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:13,366
You're a slave?

395
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:17,662
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

396
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:21,541
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

397
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:35,471
- I got ya.
- Hey!

398
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,390
Hit the nose.

399
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:45,565
A T-14 hyperdrive generator. Thee in luck.

400
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:48,318
I'm the only one hereabouts who has one.

401
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:51,946
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.

402
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:54,991
Saying of which...

403
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:57,493
how's thee gonna pay for all this, huh?

404
00:33:57,578 --> 00:33:59,704
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

405
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,623
Republic credits?

406
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:04,709
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

407
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,921
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

408
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:11,716
- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.

409
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,635
No, they won't!

410
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:17,931
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

411
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:22,310
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

412
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:26,564
No money, no parts, no deal.

413
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:31,194
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

414
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:42,330
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

415
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:47,961
We're leaving. Jar Jar.

416
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:53,132
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

417
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:55,134
I was glad to meet you too.

418
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:08,022
Outlanders. They think we know nothing.

419
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:10,066
They seemed nice to me.

420
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,110
Clean the racks...

421
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:13,569
...then you can go home.

422
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:15,530
Yippee!

423
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,913
And you're sure there's
nothing left on board?

424
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:25,957
A few containers of supplies.

425
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:29,085
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with...

426
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,546
not in the amount you're talking about.

427
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,590
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

428
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:36,092
I'll check back later.

429
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:38,553
Noah gain. Noah gain.

430
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:41,514
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

431
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:44,100
Wesa be wobbed un crunched.

432
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:47,395
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

433
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,078
Are you going to pay for that?

434
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,957
It costs seven wupiupi.

435
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:14,589
Oops.

436
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:20,970
Is this yours?

437
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:22,889
Who, mesa...

438
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:29,145
Careful, Sebulba.

439
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,272
He's a big-time outlander.

440
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,942
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

441
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:38,946
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

442
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:42,116
If you weren't a slave, I'd squash you now.

443
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:45,661
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

444
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:49,415
- Hi.
- Hi there.

445
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,876
Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.

446
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,878
He picked a fight with a Dug...

447
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:56,464
an especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba.

448
00:36:56,548 --> 00:37:00,218
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

449
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:04,305
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

450
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:06,307
Thanks, my young friend.

451
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,478
But mesa doen nutten!

452
00:37:18,946 --> 00:37:21,572
This storm will slow them down.

453
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:23,199
Looks pretty bad.

454
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,036
- Panaka.
- Receiving a message from home.

455
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:28,955
We'll be right there.

456
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:37,547
Here, you'll like these pallies.

457
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:40,299
- Here.
- Thank you.

458
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:43,719
My bones are aching.

459
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:48,391
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

460
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:51,352
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

461
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:54,063
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

462
00:37:54,148 --> 00:37:56,607
You'll never reach the outskirts in time.

463
00:37:56,692 --> 00:38:00,570
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

464
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:03,156
Come on. I'll take you to my place.

465
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:19,088
Mom!

466
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:22,925
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ah, dissen cozy.

467
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,428
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

468
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:29,098
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

469
00:38:29,183 --> 00:38:31,601
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

470
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:33,686
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.

471
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:46,741
Isn't he great? He's not finished yet.

472
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,201
He's wonderful.

473
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,120
You really like him?

474
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:54,207
He's a protocol droid to help Mom. Watch.

475
00:38:58,545 --> 00:38:59,879
Where is everybody?

476
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:01,172
Whoops.

477
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:05,551
Oh, hello.

478
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:09,013
I am C-3PO, human cyborg relations.

479
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,973
How might I serve you?

480
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:13,184
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

481
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:17,605
When the storm is over, I'll show you my racer.
I'm building a Podracer.

482
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:21,484
I'm not sure this floor is entirely stable.

483
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:24,820
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.

484
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,991
R2-D2. A pleasure to meet you.

485
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:32,161
I am C-3PO, human cyborg relations.

486
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:38,000
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?

487
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:42,922
My parts are showing? My goodness!

488
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:50,012
The death toll is catastrophic.

489
00:39:50,097 --> 00:39:52,515
We must bow to their wishes.

490
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,684
You must contact me.

491
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:57,478
It's a trick. Send no reply.

492
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,605
Send no transmissions of any kind.

493
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:04,777
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

494
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:08,864
What if it is true, and
the people are dying?

495
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:11,450
Either way, we're running out of time.

496
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,216
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

497
00:40:27,301 --> 00:40:30,136
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

498
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,138
Move against the Jedi first.

499
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:36,976
You will then have no difficulty in taking
the queen to Naboo to sign the treaty.

500
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,312
At last we will reveal
ourselves to the Jedi.

501
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:41,814
At last we will have revenge.

502
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,817
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

503
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:47,320
They will be no match for you.

504
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:56,203
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

505
00:40:57,247 --> 00:41:00,291
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

506
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:03,919
- Any attempt to escape...
- And they blow you up!

507
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,422
How wude!

508
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:08,966
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

509
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:11,010
The Republic's antislavery laws...

510
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,429
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

511
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,723
We must survive on our own.

512
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,225
Xcuse me.

513
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,855
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

514
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,774
They have Podracing on Malastare.

515
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:27,610
Very fast, very dangerous.

516
00:41:28,362 --> 00:41:30,279
I'm the only human who can do it.

517
00:41:30,364 --> 00:41:33,407
You must have Jedi
reflexes if you race pods.

518
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:35,910
Don't do that again.

519
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,959
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

520
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,799
- What makes you think that?
- I saw your laser sword.

521
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:52,843
Only Jedis carry that kind of weapon.

522
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:56,055
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

523
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,848
I don't think so.

524
00:41:57,933 --> 00:42:00,101
No one can kill a Jedi.

525
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:03,020
I wish that were so.

526
00:42:03,105 --> 00:42:05,147
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

527
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:08,442
I came back here and freed all the slaves.

528
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:11,946
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

529
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,409
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

530
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,999
I can see there's no fooling you, Anakin.

531
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:27,128
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic...

532
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:29,255
on a very important mission.

533
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:32,425
How did you end up out
here in the outer rim?

534
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:36,178
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.

535
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:40,641
I can help. I can fix anything.

536
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,268
I believe you can.

537
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:45,187
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

538
00:42:45,272 --> 00:42:48,065
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

539
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:51,694
These junk dealers
must have a weakness of some kind.

540
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:56,115
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

541
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,491
Podracing.

542
00:42:57,576 --> 00:43:00,578
Greed can be a powerful ally.

543
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:03,539
I built a racer. It's the fastest ever.

544
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,958
There's a big race tomorrow on Boonta Eve.

545
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:07,710
You could enter my pod.

546
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:12,047
- Anakin, Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

547
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:14,049
You could make him think it was yours...

548
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:16,385
and get him to let me pilot it for you.

549
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,095
I don't want you to race. It's awful.

550
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,723
I die every time Watto makes you do it.

551
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,017
But, Mom, I love it.

552
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:26,645
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

553
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,064
Anakin.

554
00:43:29,149 --> 00:43:31,942
Your mother's right.

555
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:35,196
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

556
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:38,324
No.

557
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:48,042
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

558
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,758
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

559
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,843
We'll find some other way.

560
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:02,723
There is no other way.

561
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:07,228
I may not like it, but he can help you.

562
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:09,939
He was meant to help you.

563
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:25,371
Are you sure about this?

564
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:28,165
Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know?

565
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,292
The queen will not approve.

566
00:44:30,377 --> 00:44:32,294
The queen doesn't need to know.

567
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,089
Well, I don't approve.

568
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:38,842
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

569
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:40,553
How can you do this?

570
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:43,973
Not on the Republic credits, I think.

571
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:46,267
My ship will be the entry fee.

572
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:51,564
Not bad! Not bad, huh? Nubian, huh?

573
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:54,984
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

574
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:59,071
What would the boy ride?
He smashed up my pod in the last race.

575
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:01,282
It would take some long time to fix it.

576
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:03,742
It wasn't my fault. Really.

577
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:05,536
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

578
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,998
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

579
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:12,585
That you did.

580
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:15,546
The boy's good. No doubts there, huh?

581
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,132
I have acquired a pod in a game of chance.

582
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:19,967
The fastest ever built.

583
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:25,180
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

584
00:45:27,142 --> 00:45:30,686
So, you supply the pod and the entry fee...

585
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,229
and I supply the boy.

586
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:36,233
We split the winnings 50-50, I think, huh?

587
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:38,193
If it's going to be 50-50...

588
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:40,946
I suggest you front the cash for the entry.

589
00:45:41,031 --> 00:45:43,115
If we win...

590
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,036
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

591
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,372
And if we lose, you keep my ship.

592
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:54,251
Either way, you win.

593
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,383
Deal!

594
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:10,851
Your friend is a foolish one, methinks.

595
00:46:18,777 --> 00:46:21,737
What if this plan fails, Master?

596
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:24,573
We could be stuck here a very long time.

597
00:46:24,658 --> 00:46:27,242
Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help...

598
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:30,788
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

599
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:32,831
And...

600
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:34,833
there's something about this boy.

601
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:44,051
You should be very proud of your son.

602
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,137
He gives without any thought of reward.

603
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:50,099
He knows nothing of greed.

604
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:51,350
He has...

605
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:54,186
He has special powers.

606
00:46:55,939 --> 00:46:57,189
Yes.

607
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,942
He can see things before they happen.

608
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:02,903
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

609
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,863
It's a Jedi trait.

610
00:47:04,948 --> 00:47:07,825
He deserves better than a slave's life.

611
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:11,286
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

612
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:17,459
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

613
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:19,378
Who was his father?

614
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,966
There was no father.

615
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:28,762
I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him.

616
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:32,141
I can't explain what happened.

617
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,602
Can you help him?

618
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:37,604
I don't know.

619
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:43,777
I didn't actually come here to free slaves.

620
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:58,792
Wow, a real astro droid!

621
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:04,423
- How do you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

622
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:07,509
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

623
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:09,344
With this?

624
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:12,264
You're such a joker, Ani.

625
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:15,559
- You've been working on that for years.
- It's never gonna run.

626
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,895
Come on. Let's go and play ball.

627
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:21,273
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

628
00:48:29,783 --> 00:48:32,201
Keep away from those energy binders.

629
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:35,788
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

630
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:37,331
Okay.

631
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,545
My tongue is fat.

632
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:46,799
My tongue... Wrench.

633
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:49,551
Where is de wrench? Oh, dare it is.

634
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,557
I'm stuck.

635
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:59,686
You know, I find that Jar Jar creature
to be a little odd.

636
00:49:01,523 --> 00:49:04,358
You don't even know if
this thing's gonna run.

637
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:06,568
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

638
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:08,904
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

639
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:11,114
Come on, Kitster. Let's move away.

640
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:13,408
My mouth.

641
00:49:13,493 --> 00:49:14,868
Ani, I'm stuck.

642
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:22,292
My tongue is fat.

643
00:49:22,377 --> 00:49:25,379
You're quite right. He's very odd indeed.

644
00:49:27,507 --> 00:49:29,591
Thank you.

645
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:31,176
Go.

646
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:49,278
It's working! It's working!

647
00:49:59,873 --> 00:50:02,416
Stay still, Ani. Let me clean this cut.

648
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,503
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

649
00:50:06,588 --> 00:50:08,463
Most of them.

650
00:50:08,548 --> 00:50:10,591
Has anyone been to 'em all?

651
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:13,468
Not likely.

652
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:16,805
I wanna be the first one to see 'em all.

653
00:50:17,974 --> 00:50:20,392
Ani, bedtime!

654
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:23,270
There we are. Good as new.

655
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:26,273
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

656
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:29,860
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

657
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:31,486
Go on.

658
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:33,572
You have a big day tomorrow.

659
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:35,574
Sleep well, Ani.

660
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:40,329
- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?

661
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:43,165
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

662
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:45,000
Wait a minute.

663
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:48,670
I need a midi-chlorian count.

664
00:50:51,633 --> 00:50:54,259
The reading is off the chart.

665
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:56,261
Over 20,000.

666
00:50:56,346 --> 00:51:00,015
Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.

667
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,934
No Jedi has.

668
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:04,144
What does that mean?

669
00:51:04,938 --> 00:51:06,605
I'm not sure.

670
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:19,428
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

671
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:21,304
Patience, my blue friend.

672
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:23,682
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.

673
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:25,600
And we'll be far away from here.

674
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:29,771
Not if your ship belongs
to me, I think, huh?

675
00:52:29,856 --> 00:52:33,275
I warn you, no funny business.

676
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,528
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrongo.

677
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:39,114
I have great faith in the boy.

678
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:41,366
He's a credit to your race...

679
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:44,703
but Sebulba there is going to win, I think.

680
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:48,582
Oh, no!

681
00:52:52,712 --> 00:52:54,588
Why do you think that?

682
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,590
He always wins!

683
00:52:58,593 --> 00:53:01,094
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

684
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,599
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

685
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:09,686
I'll wager my new racing
pod against, say...

686
00:53:09,771 --> 00:53:11,730
the boy and his mother.

687
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:15,567
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

688
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:18,236
The boy, then.

689
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:26,953
We'll let fate decide, huh?

690
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:30,457
I just happen to have a chance cube here.

691
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:33,627
Blue, it's the boy.

692
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:34,920
Red...

693
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:37,964
his mother.

694
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,060
You won this small toss, outlander...

695
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:52,312
but you won't win the race!

696
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,523
So it makes little difference!

697
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:09,246
Better stop your friend's betting
or I'll end up owning him too.

698
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,502
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

699
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:17,003
Good morning.

700
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:21,883
Oh, my. Space travel
sounds rather perilous.

701
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:27,973
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

702
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:31,476
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

703
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:32,686
Do what?

704
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,856
Finish the race, of course.

705
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,732
You've never won a race?

706
00:54:37,817 --> 00:54:40,569
Well, not exactly.

707
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:42,696
Not even finished?

708
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,282
Kitster's right. I will this time.

709
00:54:45,366 --> 00:54:47,492
Of course you will.

710
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:18,940
That's absolutely right.

711
00:55:19,025 --> 00:55:24,112
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

712
00:55:24,197 --> 00:55:27,866
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.

713
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:32,787
I see Ben Quadinaros from the Tund System.

714
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:40,921
Two-time winner Boles Roor.

715
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:45,258
Sebulba!

716
00:55:55,645 --> 00:55:58,772
And in the front row,
nearside pole position...

717
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:00,941
Mawhonic!

718
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:04,152
A hearty hello...

719
00:56:04,237 --> 00:56:07,989
to Clegg Holdfast and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!

720
00:56:10,952 --> 00:56:13,995
And back again, it's the mighty Dud Bolt...

721
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:18,750
with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.

722
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:24,339
And hoping for a big win today...

723
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:28,885
Ody Mandrell,
with his record-setting pit droid team.

724
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:37,018
And a late entry, young Anakin Skywalker...

725
00:56:37,103 --> 00:56:38,436
a local boy.

726
00:56:41,107 --> 00:56:43,441
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

727
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,171
Be safe.

728
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:07,632
I will, Mom. I promise.

729
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:26,484
You won't walk away from this one...

730
00:57:26,569 --> 00:57:28,862
you slave scum.

731
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:32,240
Don't count on it, slime ball.

732
00:57:32,325 --> 00:57:34,743
You're bantha fodder!

733
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:41,541
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

734
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,293
Right.

735
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:50,050
Remember, concentrate on the moment.

736
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:53,928
Feel, don't think. Use your instincts.

737
00:57:54,013 --> 00:57:55,680
I will.

738
00:57:55,765 --> 00:57:58,058
May the Force be with you.

739
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:09,027
Jabba the Hutt.

740
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:22,832
Welcome.

741
00:58:24,585 --> 00:58:27,462
Begin the race!

742
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:41,601
Hey, looks like they're clearing the grid.

743
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,646
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

744
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:49,192
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not...

745
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:52,195
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

746
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:54,531
You should too.

747
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:56,741
You assume too much.

748
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:59,869
Start your engines.

749
00:59:39,118 --> 00:59:42,495
Oh, dissen gonna be messy. Me no watch'n!

750
01:00:02,475 --> 01:00:03,850
Oh, no!

751
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:12,734
Wait. Little Skywalker has stalled.

752
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:27,415
It looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.

753
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:30,335
Come on, Ani!

754
01:00:36,717 --> 01:00:38,343
And there goes Skywalker!

755
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:39,886
Go, Ani, go!

756
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,180
He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.

757
01:01:56,213 --> 01:02:01,634
Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out on the canyon dune turn.

758
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:16,524
There goes Quadinaros' power coupling.

759
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:46,512
Oh, no!

760
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:53,186
Where is Master Anakin?

761
01:02:56,357 --> 01:02:58,650
Look. Here he comes.

762
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:03,863
It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field.

763
01:03:04,823 --> 01:03:06,157
Yay! Yippee!

764
01:03:13,582 --> 01:03:17,210
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.

765
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:26,654
Skywalker's spinning out of control!

766
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:28,549
I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

767
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:36,808
Here he comes!

768
01:05:36,892 --> 01:05:40,603
At the start of the third and final lap,
Sebulba's in the lead...

769
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:43,189
followed closely by Skywalker!

770
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:44,190
Go, Ani!

771
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:13,553
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

772
01:06:35,242 --> 01:06:36,617
It's Skywalker!

773
01:06:37,578 --> 01:06:38,911
Sebulba!

774
01:06:38,996 --> 01:06:43,332
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

775
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:45,209
Did he crash-ed?

776
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:29,337
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

777
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:24,058
He's catching Sebulba!

778
01:08:25,102 --> 01:08:27,687
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

779
01:08:57,968 --> 01:09:00,428
That little human being is out of his mind!

780
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:02,722
They're side by side!

781
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:33,252
- Yippee!
- Yay!

782
01:09:37,424 --> 01:09:39,175
I can't believe it.

783
01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:41,260
The crowds are going nuts!

784
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:52,188
Yay, Ani!

785
01:09:53,482 --> 01:09:56,567
Mom, I did it! Yay!

786
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:08,954
Good going, Ani!

787
01:10:13,293 --> 01:10:15,294
We owe you everything, Ani.

788
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:20,007
It's so wonderful, Ani.

789
01:10:20,092 --> 01:10:22,843
You have brought hope
to those who have none.

790
01:10:22,928 --> 01:10:25,805
I'm so very proud of you.

791
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:37,525
You!

792
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:39,985
You swindled me.

793
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:43,906
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehow you knew it.

794
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,908
I lost everything.

795
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:49,578
Whenever you gamble, my friend,
eventually you lose.

796
01:10:49,663 --> 01:10:52,164
Bring the parts to the main hangar.

797
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:55,334
I'll come by your shop later on
so you can release the boy.

798
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:58,796
You can't have him. It wasn't a fair bet.

799
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:05,010
Would you like to discuss
it with the Hutts?

800
01:11:05,095 --> 01:11:07,638
I'm sure they can settle this.

801
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:11,016
Take him.

802
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:19,024
Hidoe!

803
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,778
Well, we have all the
essential parts we need.

804
01:11:22,863 --> 01:11:23,863
I'm going back.

805
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:26,073
Some unfinished business. I won't be long.

806
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:29,702
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?

807
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:33,622
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.

808
01:11:33,707 --> 01:11:35,624
Get this hyperdrive generator installed.

809
01:11:35,709 --> 01:11:38,294
Yes, Master. That shouldn't take long.

810
01:11:38,378 --> 01:11:40,546
Come on. Hup!

811
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:47,094
Hey. These are yours.

812
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,347
Yes!

813
01:11:51,892 --> 01:11:54,643
Mom, we sold the pod!
Look at all the money we have!

814
01:11:54,728 --> 01:11:57,146
My goodness! But that's so wonderful, Ani.

815
01:11:57,230 --> 01:12:00,232
- And he has been freed.
- What?

816
01:12:00,317 --> 01:12:02,109
You're no longer a slave.

817
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:05,946
Did you hear that?

818
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:09,241
Now you can make your
dreams come true, Ani.

819
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:12,036
You are free.

820
01:12:15,582 --> 01:12:17,041
Will you take him with you?

821
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:18,834
Is he to become a Jedi?

822
01:12:18,919 --> 01:12:21,462
Yes. Our meeting was not a coincidence.

823
01:12:22,297 --> 01:12:24,006
Nothing happens by accident.

824
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:27,676
You mean I get to come with you
in your starship?

825
01:12:27,761 --> 01:12:29,261
Anakin...

826
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:34,433
training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge...

827
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:37,394
and even if you succeed, it's a hard life.

828
01:12:37,479 --> 01:12:40,731
But I wanna go. It's what
I've always dreamed of doing.

829
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:43,651
Can I go, Mom?

830
01:12:44,611 --> 01:12:46,362
Anakin...

831
01:12:46,446 --> 01:12:49,365
this path has been placed before you.

832
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:51,951
The choice is yours alone.

833
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:57,456
I wanna do it.

834
01:12:59,501 --> 01:13:02,294
Then pack your things.
We haven't much time.

835
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:10,469
What about Mom?

836
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:15,474
Is she free too?

837
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:19,144
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

838
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:22,147
You're coming with us, aren't you, Mom?

839
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:33,450
Son, my place is here. My future is here.

840
01:13:33,535 --> 01:13:35,995
It is time for you to let go.

841
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:39,248
I don't want things to change.

842
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:41,750
But you can't stop the change...

843
01:13:41,835 --> 01:13:45,004
any more than you can
stop the suns from setting.

844
01:13:46,006 --> 01:13:48,007
I love you.

845
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:55,514
Now hurry.

846
01:14:01,021 --> 01:14:02,438
Thank you.

847
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:05,524
I'll watch after him. You have my word.

848
01:14:07,694 --> 01:14:09,236
Will you be all right?

849
01:14:10,697 --> 01:14:12,156
Yeah.

850
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:18,787
Hello, Master Anakin.

851
01:14:18,872 --> 01:14:20,998
Well, 3PO, I've been freed...

852
01:14:21,082 --> 01:14:23,500
and I'm going away in a starship.

853
01:14:23,585 --> 01:14:26,503
Master Anakin, you are my maker
and I wish you well.

854
01:14:26,588 --> 01:14:30,841
However, I should prefer it
if I were a little more completed.

855
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:34,136
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to finish you, 3PO...

856
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,305
give you coverings and all.

857
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:38,015
I'm gonna miss working on you.

858
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:40,642
You've been a great pal.

859
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:43,395
I'll make sure Mom
doesn't sell you or anything.

860
01:14:44,147 --> 01:14:45,189
Sell me?

861
01:14:45,273 --> 01:14:46,940
Bye.

862
01:14:47,025 --> 01:14:48,484
Oh, my.

863
01:15:13,093 --> 01:15:15,302
I can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it.

864
01:15:19,599 --> 01:15:21,600
Will I ever see you again?

865
01:15:23,103 --> 01:15:25,938
What does your heart tell you?

866
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:29,274
I hope so.

867
01:15:29,943 --> 01:15:31,860
Yes.

868
01:15:31,945 --> 01:15:33,570
I guess.

869
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:37,199
Then we will see each other again.

870
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:42,704
I will come back and free you, Mom.

871
01:15:42,789 --> 01:15:44,498
I promise.

872
01:15:52,799 --> 01:15:55,759
Now, be brave...

873
01:15:56,511 --> 01:15:58,512
and don't look back.

874
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:01,223
Don't look back.

875
01:16:45,727 --> 01:16:47,644
Qui-Gon, sir, wait! I'm tired!

876
01:16:47,729 --> 01:16:48,729
Anakin! Drop!

877
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:52,191
Go!

878
01:16:53,193 --> 01:16:55,194
Tell them to take off!

879
01:17:07,707 --> 01:17:09,208
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

880
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:11,877
Take off.

881
01:17:12,504 --> 01:17:14,338
Over there. Fly low.

882
01:17:35,902 --> 01:17:38,987
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

883
01:17:39,072 --> 01:17:40,656
What was it?

884
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,491
I'm not sure...

885
01:17:42,575 --> 01:17:45,327
but it was well-trained in the Jedi arts.

886
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:47,746
My guess is it was after the queen.

887
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:50,415
What are we gonna do about it?

888
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:54,002
We shall be patient.

889
01:17:54,087 --> 01:17:55,212
Anakin Skywalker...

890
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:57,589
meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

891
01:17:59,509 --> 01:18:02,135
You're a Jedi too? Pleased to meet you.

892
01:18:11,104 --> 01:18:13,689
Your queen is lost,
your people are starving...

893
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:15,774
and you, Governor, are going to die...

894
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:18,026
much sooner than your people, I'm afraid.

895
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,696
This invasion will gain you nothing.

896
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:23,782
We're a democracy. The people have decided.

897
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:25,784
Take him away.

898
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:31,707
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...

899
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:34,376
for these rumored underwater villages.

900
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:37,129
They will not stay hidden for long.

901
01:18:48,141 --> 01:18:50,892
The death toll is catastrophic.

902
01:18:50,977 --> 01:18:53,604
We must bow to their wishes.

903
01:18:53,688 --> 01:18:55,981
You must contact me.

904
01:19:10,038 --> 01:19:11,997
You all right?

905
01:19:13,041 --> 01:19:15,000
It's very cold.

906
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:25,761
You come from a warm planet, Ani.

907
01:19:25,845 --> 01:19:28,263
A little too warm for my taste.

908
01:19:28,348 --> 01:19:30,557
Space is cold.

909
01:19:30,642 --> 01:19:32,851
You seem sad.

910
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:36,271
The queen is worried.

911
01:19:36,356 --> 01:19:38,732
Her people are suffering, dying.

912
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:42,402
She must convince the senate
to intervene or...

913
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:46,198
I'm not sure what'll happen.

914
01:19:47,617 --> 01:19:49,701
I made this for you...

915
01:19:51,204 --> 01:19:53,038
so you'd remember me.

916
01:19:53,748 --> 01:19:56,458
I carved it out of a japor snippet.

917
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:59,378
It'll bring you good fortune.

918
01:19:59,462 --> 01:20:01,463
It's beautiful.

919
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:03,882
But I don't need this to remember you by.

920
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:10,972
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani...

921
01:20:11,057 --> 01:20:13,642
but my caring for you will remain.

922
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:19,481
I care for you, too, only I...

923
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:21,733
Miss your mother.

924
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:44,381
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

925
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:46,258
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

926
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:49,636
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

927
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:22,169
It is a great gift
to see you alive, Your Majesty.

928
01:21:22,253 --> 01:21:25,297
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.

929
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:27,883
I'm anxious to hear your report
on the situation.

930
01:21:27,967 --> 01:21:30,635
May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

931
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,721
Welcome, Your Highness.

932
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:34,848
It's an honor to finally
meet you in person.

933
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:36,475
Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.

934
01:21:36,559 --> 01:21:40,103
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

935
01:21:40,188 --> 01:21:43,648
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.

936
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:47,903
I'm grateful for your concern, Chancellor.

937
01:21:47,987 --> 01:21:49,905
There is a question of procedure...

938
01:21:49,989 --> 01:21:52,491
but I'm confident we can overcome it.

939
01:21:53,326 --> 01:21:55,494
I must speak with the
Jedi Council immediately.

940
01:21:55,578 --> 01:21:58,455
The situation has become
much more complicated.

941
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:06,129
Ani, come on.

942
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:20,060
Da queen's a bein grossly nice, mesa tinks.

943
01:22:21,354 --> 01:22:23,355
Pitty hot.

944
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:54,386
There is no civility, only politics.

945
01:22:55,638 --> 01:22:59,558
The Republic is not what it once was.

946
01:22:59,642 --> 01:23:04,896
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

947
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:09,109
There is no interest in the common good.

948
01:23:09,986 --> 01:23:11,653
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

949
01:23:11,737 --> 01:23:14,489
There is little chance the senate
will act on the invasion.

950
01:23:14,574 --> 01:23:17,325
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

951
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:21,663
If I may say so, Your Majesty,
the chancellor has little real power.

952
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:25,667
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.

953
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:29,546
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?

954
01:23:30,256 --> 01:23:33,174
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

955
01:23:33,259 --> 01:23:35,510
of a stronger supreme chancellor...

956
01:23:35,595 --> 01:23:37,762
one who could control the bureaucrats...

957
01:23:37,847 --> 01:23:39,764
and give us justice.

958
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:46,104
You could call for a vote of
no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.

959
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:48,732
He has been our strongest supporter.

960
01:23:48,816 --> 01:23:54,070
Our only other choice would be
to submit a plea to the courts.

961
01:23:54,155 --> 01:23:57,574
The courts take even longer
to decide things than the senate.

962
01:23:58,451 --> 01:24:00,577
Our people are dying, Senator.

963
01:24:01,329 --> 01:24:04,372
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

964
01:24:04,457 --> 01:24:07,042
To be realistic, Your Majesty...

965
01:24:07,126 --> 01:24:09,586
I think we're going to have to
accept Federation control...

966
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:12,255
for the time being.

967
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:16,134
That is something I cannot do.

968
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:25,977
He was trained in the Jedi arts.

969
01:24:26,062 --> 01:24:30,023
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

970
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:31,566
Impossible.

971
01:24:31,651 --> 01:24:34,319
The Sith have been extinct
for a millennium.

972
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:38,657
I do not believe the Sith could
have returned without us knowing.

973
01:24:39,659 --> 01:24:41,826
Hard to see, the dark side is.

974
01:24:41,911 --> 01:24:44,829
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

975
01:24:44,914 --> 01:24:48,249
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

976
01:24:48,334 --> 01:24:50,001
May the Force be with you.

977
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:55,507
Master Qui-Gon.

978
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:58,176
More to say have you?

979
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:02,180
With your permission, my master...

980
01:25:03,683 --> 01:25:06,685
I have encountered a vergence in the Force.

981
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:09,813
A vergence, you say.

982
01:25:09,897 --> 01:25:12,065
Located around a person?

983
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:13,483
A boy.

984
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:16,111
His cells have the highest
concentration of midi-chlorians...

985
01:25:16,195 --> 01:25:17,988
I have seen in a life-form.

986
01:25:18,072 --> 01:25:21,032
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

987
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:26,579
You refer to the prophecy of the one
who will bring balance to the Force.

988
01:25:27,373 --> 01:25:29,499
You believe it's this boy?

989
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:32,210
- I don't presume to...
- But you do.

990
01:25:32,962 --> 01:25:34,963
Revealed your opinion is.

991
01:25:35,047 --> 01:25:37,090
I request the boy be tested, Master.

992
01:25:39,218 --> 01:25:42,429
Trained as a Jedi you request for him, hmm?

993
01:25:42,513 --> 01:25:44,973
Finding him was the will of the Force.

994
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:47,350
I have no doubt of that.

995
01:25:53,983 --> 01:25:56,067
Bring him before us, then.

996
01:26:07,121 --> 01:26:09,039
The boy's here to see Padmé.

997
01:26:09,123 --> 01:26:10,749
Let him in.

998
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:17,839
I'm sorry, Ani, but Padmé's
not here right now.

999
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:19,632
Who is it?

1000
01:26:19,717 --> 01:26:23,428
Anakin Skywalker to see
Padmé, Your Highness.

1001
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:25,346
I've sent Padmé on an errand.

1002
01:26:25,431 --> 01:26:27,307
I'm on my way to the Jedi temple...

1003
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:29,768
to start my training, I hope.

1004
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:34,397
I may never see her again,
so I came to say good-bye.

1005
01:26:35,441 --> 01:26:39,110
We will tell her for you.
We are sure her heart goes with you.

1006
01:26:40,196 --> 01:26:41,279
Thank you, Your Highness.

1007
01:26:55,211 --> 01:26:59,339
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

1008
01:27:06,138 --> 01:27:09,557
Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate...

1009
01:27:10,601 --> 01:27:13,019
a tragedy has occurred...

1010
01:27:13,104 --> 01:27:16,648
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...

1011
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:19,776
and has now engulfed our entire planet...

1012
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:21,945
in the oppression of the Trade Federation.

1013
01:27:22,822 --> 01:27:24,239
This is outrageous!

1014
01:27:24,323 --> 01:27:26,908
I object to the senator's statements.

1015
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:31,079
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.

1016
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:35,083
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala...

1017
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:37,168
recently elected ruler of the Naboo...

1018
01:27:37,253 --> 01:27:39,212
who speaks on our behalf.

1019
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:48,012
Honorable representatives
of the Republic...

1020
01:27:48,681 --> 01:27:51,182
I come to you under the gravest
of circumstances.

1021
01:27:51,267 --> 01:27:54,185
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade...

1022
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:57,814
I object! There is no proof!

1023
01:27:57,898 --> 01:27:59,858
This is incredible.

1024
01:27:59,942 --> 01:28:03,945
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

1025
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:05,363
The Congress of Malastare...

1026
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:08,491
concurs with the honorable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

1027
01:28:08,576 --> 01:28:10,660
A commission must be appointed.

1028
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:13,288
- The point...
- Excuse me, Chancellor.

1029
01:28:13,372 --> 01:28:14,998
Enter the bureaucrat.

1030
01:28:15,082 --> 01:28:17,792
The true rulers of the Republic.

1031
01:28:17,877 --> 01:28:22,046
And on the payroll
of the Trade Federation, I might add.

1032
01:28:22,131 --> 01:28:26,426
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.

1033
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:30,305
The point is conceded.

1034
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:33,057
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission...

1035
01:28:33,142 --> 01:28:35,935
to explore the validity of your accusations?

1036
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:37,979
I will not defer.

1037
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:41,566
I've come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now.

1038
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:44,694
I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die...

1039
01:28:44,778 --> 01:28:47,530
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

1040
01:28:50,451 --> 01:28:52,827
If this body is not capable of action...

1041
01:28:52,912 --> 01:28:54,996
I suggest new leadership is needed.

1042
01:28:58,417 --> 01:29:00,668
I move for a vote of no confidence...

1043
01:29:00,753 --> 01:29:02,754
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

1044
01:29:09,762 --> 01:29:11,930
Vote now! Vote now!

1045
01:29:15,768 --> 01:29:17,685
Order!

1046
01:29:17,770 --> 01:29:20,688
Now they will elect a new chancellor...

1047
01:29:20,773 --> 01:29:22,690
a strong chancellor...

1048
01:29:22,775 --> 01:29:25,777
one who will not let our tragedy continue.

1049
01:29:27,446 --> 01:29:31,699
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.

1050
01:29:31,784 --> 01:29:34,953
Anakin will become a Jedi, I promise you.

1051
01:29:35,037 --> 01:29:37,747
Do not defy the council, Master, not again.

1052
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:40,625
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

1053
01:29:42,503 --> 01:29:46,297
If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

1054
01:29:46,382 --> 01:29:48,466
They will not go along with you this time.

1055
01:29:49,969 --> 01:29:52,553
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.

1056
01:29:55,808 --> 01:29:57,183
A ship.

1057
01:29:58,811 --> 01:30:00,770
A cup.

1058
01:30:00,854 --> 01:30:02,689
A ship.

1059
01:30:03,816 --> 01:30:05,316
A speeder.

1060
01:30:12,825 --> 01:30:14,784
How feel you?

1061
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:16,995
Cold, sir.

1062
01:30:18,664 --> 01:30:20,832
- Afraid are you?
- No, sir.

1063
01:30:22,001 --> 01:30:24,627
See through you we can.

1064
01:30:24,712 --> 01:30:26,629
Be mindful of your feelings.

1065
01:30:26,714 --> 01:30:29,507
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

1066
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:32,677
I miss her.

1067
01:30:33,804 --> 01:30:36,306
Afraid to lose her, I think, mmm?

1068
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:38,599
What has that got to do with anything?

1069
01:30:38,684 --> 01:30:41,060
Everything.

1070
01:30:41,145 --> 01:30:44,230
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1071
01:30:44,315 --> 01:30:47,233
Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate.

1072
01:30:47,318 --> 01:30:50,695
Hate leads to suffering.

1073
01:30:57,202 --> 01:31:00,163
I sense much fear in you.

1074
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:16,471
Yousa tinking yousa people ganna die?

1075
01:31:16,555 --> 01:31:17,889
I don't know.

1076
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:21,100
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1077
01:31:23,562 --> 01:31:25,605
I hope not.

1078
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:28,649
Gungans no die'n without a fight.

1079
01:31:28,734 --> 01:31:30,651
Wesa warriors.

1080
01:31:30,736 --> 01:31:33,988
Wesa got a grand army.

1081
01:31:34,073 --> 01:31:37,325
Dat's why you no liken us, mesa tinks.

1082
01:31:37,409 --> 01:31:38,785
Your Highness?

1083
01:31:41,413 --> 01:31:43,623
Your Highness...

1084
01:31:43,707 --> 01:31:46,834
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...

1085
01:31:46,919 --> 01:31:48,336
as supreme chancellor.

1086
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:52,340
A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.

1087
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:56,844
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1088
01:31:56,929 --> 01:31:58,596
Who else has been nominated?

1089
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:03,017
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1090
01:32:03,102 --> 01:32:08,106
I feel confident our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1091
01:32:09,775 --> 01:32:11,776
I will be chancellor.

1092
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:14,529
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats, Senator...

1093
01:32:14,613 --> 01:32:17,865
there'll be nothing left
of our people, our way of life.

1094
01:32:17,950 --> 01:32:19,867
I understand your concern, Your Majesty.

1095
01:32:19,952 --> 01:32:23,496
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1096
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:29,127
Senator, this is your arena.

1097
01:32:29,795 --> 01:32:31,421
I feel I must return to mine.

1098
01:32:34,633 --> 01:32:36,926
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1099
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:37,927
Go back?

1100
01:32:38,011 --> 01:32:41,013
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

1101
01:32:41,098 --> 01:32:43,558
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1102
01:32:43,642 --> 01:32:46,436
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1103
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:48,146
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

1104
01:32:48,230 --> 01:32:50,565
- Ready my ship.
- Please, Your Majesty.

1105
01:32:50,649 --> 01:32:52,608
Stay here where it's safe.

1106
01:32:54,027 --> 01:32:57,280
It is clear to me now that
the Republic no longer functions.

1107
01:32:57,990 --> 01:33:02,160
I pray you will bring sanity
and compassion back to the senate.

1108
01:33:11,837 --> 01:33:14,422
The Force is strong with him.

1109
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:16,507
He is to be trained, then?

1110
01:33:18,552 --> 01:33:20,970
No, he will not be trained.

1111
01:33:21,054 --> 01:33:22,805
No?

1112
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:26,851
He is too old.

1113
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:30,813
He is the chosen one. You must see it.

1114
01:33:31,899 --> 01:33:35,526
Clouded this boy's future is.

1115
01:33:37,696 --> 01:33:39,530
I will train him, then.

1116
01:33:43,869 --> 01:33:46,704
I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.

1117
01:33:46,788 --> 01:33:49,790
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

1118
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:52,251
Impossible to take on a second.

1119
01:33:52,336 --> 01:33:54,045
The code forbids it.

1120
01:33:54,129 --> 01:33:57,548
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

1121
01:33:57,633 --> 01:34:01,344
Our own counsel we will
keep on who is ready.

1122
01:34:02,262 --> 01:34:05,181
He is headstrong and he has much
to learn of the living Force...

1123
01:34:05,265 --> 01:34:06,766
but he is capable.

1124
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:08,893
There is little more he can learn from me.

1125
01:34:11,438 --> 01:34:15,316
Young Skywalker's fate
will be decided later.

1126
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,027
Now is not the time for this.

1127
01:34:18,737 --> 01:34:20,738
The senate is voting
for a new supreme chancellor...

1128
01:34:20,822 --> 01:34:23,533
and Queen Amidala is returning home...

1129
01:34:23,617 --> 01:34:26,869
which puts pressure on the Federation
and could widen the confrontation.

1130
01:34:26,954 --> 01:34:29,288
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1131
01:34:29,373 --> 01:34:33,793
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.

1132
01:34:35,045 --> 01:34:36,671
This is the clue we need...

1133
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:39,382
to unravel the mystery of the Sith.

1134
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:42,260
May the Force be with you.

1135
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:58,359
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

1136
01:34:58,443 --> 01:35:00,361
From your point of view.

1137
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:03,864
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1138
01:35:03,949 --> 01:35:06,867
His fate is uncertain. He's not dangerous.

1139
01:35:06,952 --> 01:35:09,370
The council will decide Anakin's future.

1140
01:35:09,454 --> 01:35:12,415
That should be enough for you.
Now get on board.

1141
01:35:18,005 --> 01:35:21,841
Qui-Gon, sir, I don't want to be a problem.

1142
01:35:21,925 --> 01:35:24,176
You won't be, Ani.

1143
01:35:24,261 --> 01:35:26,220
I'm not allowed to train you...

1144
01:35:26,305 --> 01:35:28,347
so I want you to watch me and be mindful.

1145
01:35:28,432 --> 01:35:30,600
Always remember:

1146
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:34,103
Your focus determines your reality.

1147
01:35:34,187 --> 01:35:37,857
Stay close to me and you'll be safe.

1148
01:35:37,941 --> 01:35:39,317
Master, sir...

1149
01:35:39,401 --> 01:35:43,029
I heard Yoda talking about midi-chlorians.

1150
01:35:43,113 --> 01:35:46,657
I've been wondering...
What are midi-chlorians?

1151
01:35:47,951 --> 01:35:50,369
Midi-chlorians are a
microscopic life-form...

1152
01:35:50,454 --> 01:35:52,705
that resides within all living cells.

1153
01:35:54,166 --> 01:35:57,043
- They live inside me?
- Inside your cells, yes.

1154
01:35:57,127 --> 01:36:00,630
- And we are symbionts with them.
- Symbionts?

1155
01:36:00,714 --> 01:36:04,634
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.

1156
01:36:04,718 --> 01:36:07,637
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist...

1157
01:36:07,721 --> 01:36:10,598
and we would have no
knowledge of the Force.

1158
01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:12,558
They continually speak to us...

1159
01:36:12,643 --> 01:36:15,353
telling us the will of the Force.

1160
01:36:15,437 --> 01:36:17,605
When you learn to quiet your mind...

1161
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:19,607
you'll hear them speaking to you.

1162
01:36:19,691 --> 01:36:21,609
I don't understand.

1163
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:25,196
With time and training, Ani,
you will. You will.

1164
01:36:29,201 --> 01:36:33,037
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure
to continue to serve and protect you.

1165
01:36:33,705 --> 01:36:35,122
I welcome your help.

1166
01:36:35,207 --> 01:36:38,959
Senator Palpatine fears that
the Federation means to destroy me.

1167
01:36:39,044 --> 01:36:42,088
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.

1168
01:36:42,172 --> 01:36:45,132
Wesa goin' home!

1169
01:36:45,217 --> 01:36:47,093
Come on, R2.

1170
01:36:57,354 --> 01:36:59,730
Is the planet secure?

1171
01:36:59,815 --> 01:37:03,776
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1172
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:06,987
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1173
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:10,282
Good. I will see to it
that in the senate...

1174
01:37:10,367 --> 01:37:13,327
things stay as they are.

1175
01:37:13,412 --> 01:37:16,956
I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you.

1176
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,958
Yes, my lord.

1177
01:37:19,042 --> 01:37:20,918
A Sith here?

1178
01:37:26,299 --> 01:37:28,801
Those are the forward stabilizers.

1179
01:37:28,885 --> 01:37:31,303
And those two control the pitch?

1180
01:37:32,889 --> 01:37:34,765
You catch on pretty quick.

1181
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:36,684
As soon as we land...

1182
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:39,395
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.

1183
01:37:39,479 --> 01:37:40,604
I agree.

1184
01:37:40,689 --> 01:37:43,441
I'm not sure what you wish
to accomplish by this.

1185
01:37:43,525 --> 01:37:46,068
I will take back what's ours.

1186
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:48,988
There are too few of us, Your Highness.

1187
01:37:49,072 --> 01:37:51,031
We have no army.

1188
01:37:51,116 --> 01:37:52,575
And I can only protect you.

1189
01:37:52,659 --> 01:37:54,660
I can't fight a war for you.

1190
01:37:55,662 --> 01:37:56,787
Jar Jar Binks.

1191
01:37:57,622 --> 01:37:59,874
Mesa, Your Highness?

1192
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:02,918
Yes. I need your help.

1193
01:38:08,091 --> 01:38:10,342
I have one battleship on my scope.

1194
01:38:10,427 --> 01:38:12,553
It's a droid control ship.

1195
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:14,889
They've probably spotted us.

1196
01:38:14,973 --> 01:38:16,682
We haven't much time.

1197
01:38:28,361 --> 01:38:31,071
Jar Jar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.

1198
01:38:31,156 --> 01:38:32,531
Good.

1199
01:38:32,616 --> 01:38:34,909
Do you think the queen's idea will work?

1200
01:38:34,993 --> 01:38:36,660
The Gungans will not be easily swayed.

1201
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:41,040
And we cannot use our power to help her.

1202
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:45,920
I'm sorry for my behavior, Master.

1203
01:38:46,004 --> 01:38:49,799
It's not my place to disagree
with you about the boy.

1204
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:55,012
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1205
01:38:56,139 --> 01:38:58,015
You've been a good apprentice, Obi-Wan.

1206
01:38:59,476 --> 01:39:02,186
And you're a much wiser man than I am.

1207
01:39:02,854 --> 01:39:06,190
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.

1208
01:39:19,204 --> 01:39:21,580
Desa nobody dare!

1209
01:39:21,665 --> 01:39:23,874
The Gungan city is deserted!

1210
01:39:23,959 --> 01:39:26,544
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

1211
01:39:26,628 --> 01:39:29,797
Do you think they have been taken
to the camps?

1212
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:32,216
More likely they were wiped out.

1213
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:35,386
- Mesa no tink so.
- Do you know where they are, Jar Jar?

1214
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:38,931
When in trouble, Gungans
go to sacred place.

1215
01:39:39,015 --> 01:39:41,934
Mesa show you. Come on. Mesa show you!

1216
01:40:00,245 --> 01:40:03,914
Your Honor, Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1217
01:40:10,547 --> 01:40:13,924
Heyo dadee Big Boss Nass, Your Honor.

1218
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:17,094
Jar Jar Binks.

1219
01:40:17,178 --> 01:40:20,890
Who's da uss-en uthers?

1220
01:40:21,433 --> 01:40:23,767
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1221
01:40:24,561 --> 01:40:27,021
I come before you in peace.

1222
01:40:27,105 --> 01:40:29,940
Ah, Naboo biggen.

1223
01:40:30,025 --> 01:40:33,235
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

1224
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:37,114
Yousa all bombad.

1225
01:40:37,949 --> 01:40:40,826
We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.

1226
01:40:40,911 --> 01:40:42,286
Your Honor.

1227
01:40:44,456 --> 01:40:47,416
Whosa dis?

1228
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:49,793
I am Queen Amidala.

1229
01:40:51,379 --> 01:40:53,047
This is my decoy...

1230
01:40:53,131 --> 01:40:56,759
my protection, my loyal bodyguard.

1231
01:40:56,843 --> 01:41:01,180
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.

1232
01:41:01,264 --> 01:41:03,891
Although we do not always agree,
Your Honor...

1233
01:41:03,975 --> 01:41:06,518
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1234
01:41:08,271 --> 01:41:11,482
The Trade Federation has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

1235
01:41:11,566 --> 01:41:14,902
If we do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.

1236
01:41:14,986 --> 01:41:17,237
I ask you to help us.

1237
01:41:17,322 --> 01:41:20,074
No, I beg you to help us.

1238
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:22,534
We are your humble servants.

1239
01:41:25,789 --> 01:41:28,624
Our fate is in your hands.

1240
01:41:45,767 --> 01:41:50,062
Yousa no tinken yousa
greater den da Gungans?

1241
01:41:52,524 --> 01:41:56,485
Mesa lika dis!

1242
01:41:57,362 --> 01:41:58,362
Maybe...

1243
01:41:58,446 --> 01:42:01,073
wesa...

1244
01:42:01,157 --> 01:42:03,033
being friends.

1245
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:13,544
We've sent our patrols.

1246
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:17,131
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1247
01:42:17,215 --> 01:42:19,425
It won't be long, my lord.

1248
01:42:19,509 --> 01:42:22,678
This is an unexpected move for her.

1249
01:42:22,762 --> 01:42:24,805
It's too aggressive.

1250
01:42:24,889 --> 01:42:27,349
Lord Maul, be mindful.

1251
01:42:27,434 --> 01:42:30,019
Let them make the first move.

1252
01:42:30,103 --> 01:42:32,062
Yes, my master.

1253
01:42:35,567 --> 01:42:37,234
Deysa comin!

1254
01:42:37,318 --> 01:42:38,736
All right!

1255
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:43,991
They're here!

1256
01:42:44,075 --> 01:42:45,534
Good. They made it.

1257
01:42:50,081 --> 01:42:52,791
Yousa doen grand.

1258
01:42:52,876 --> 01:42:56,003
Jar Jar bring uss-en and da Naboo together.

1259
01:42:56,087 --> 01:42:58,005
Oh, no, no, no.

1260
01:42:58,089 --> 01:43:01,050
So, wesa make you...

1261
01:43:01,134 --> 01:43:03,677
bombad general.

1262
01:43:03,762 --> 01:43:05,262
General?

1263
01:43:08,266 --> 01:43:09,808
Captain.

1264
01:43:09,893 --> 01:43:12,519
- Your Highness.
- What is the situation?

1265
01:43:12,604 --> 01:43:14,521
Almost everyone's in camps.

1266
01:43:14,606 --> 01:43:17,858
A few hundred police and guards have formed
an underground resistance movement.

1267
01:43:17,942 --> 01:43:20,527
I brought back as many
of the leaders as I could.

1268
01:43:20,612 --> 01:43:23,530
The Federation army's also
much larger than we thought...

1269
01:43:23,615 --> 01:43:25,282
and much stronger.

1270
01:43:26,576 --> 01:43:29,703
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1271
01:43:29,788 --> 01:43:32,039
The battle is a diversion.

1272
01:43:32,123 --> 01:43:35,000
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1273
01:43:35,085 --> 01:43:36,668
R2.

1274
01:43:37,754 --> 01:43:41,256
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

1275
01:43:41,341 --> 01:43:43,092
Once we get to the main entrance...

1276
01:43:43,176 --> 01:43:46,303
Captain Panaka will create a diversion.

1277
01:43:46,387 --> 01:43:49,348
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

1278
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:52,893
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1279
01:43:52,977 --> 01:43:54,728
What do you think, Master Jedi?

1280
01:43:54,813 --> 01:43:56,980
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1281
01:43:57,065 --> 01:43:59,608
The difficulty is getting
into the throne room.

1282
01:43:59,692 --> 01:44:02,027
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1283
01:44:02,112 --> 01:44:06,865
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

1284
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:10,285
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1285
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:13,580
We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.

1286
01:44:13,665 --> 01:44:15,582
We will send what pilots we have...

1287
01:44:15,667 --> 01:44:18,710
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1288
01:44:18,795 --> 01:44:21,922
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1289
01:44:22,006 --> 01:44:25,134
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.

1290
01:44:25,218 --> 01:44:26,927
There's an even bigger danger.

1291
01:44:27,011 --> 01:44:28,929
If the viceroy escapes, Your Highness...

1292
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:31,265
he will return with another droid army.

1293
01:44:31,349 --> 01:44:34,601
Well, that is why we must not fail
to get the viceroy.

1294
01:44:34,686 --> 01:44:36,645
Everything depends on it.

1295
01:44:41,943 --> 01:44:44,611
She is more foolish than I thought.

1296
01:44:44,696 --> 01:44:49,658
We are sending all troops to meet
this army assembling near the swamp.

1297
01:44:49,742 --> 01:44:52,452
It appears to be made up of primitives.

1298
01:44:52,537 --> 01:44:55,122
This will work to our advantage.

1299
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:58,041
I have your approval
to proceed, then, my lord?

1300
01:44:58,793 --> 01:45:00,544
Wipe them out.

1301
01:45:02,213 --> 01:45:04,131
All of them.

1302
01:45:34,954 --> 01:45:36,413
Halt!

1303
01:45:39,792 --> 01:45:42,085
Starting up the shield.

1304
01:46:11,616 --> 01:46:12,824
Open fire.

1305
01:46:28,967 --> 01:46:32,219
Once we get inside, you find
a safe place to hide and stay there.

1306
01:46:32,303 --> 01:46:34,221
- Sure.
- Stay there.

1307
01:46:50,154 --> 01:46:52,281
Roger, roger.

1308
01:47:00,248 --> 01:47:03,375
I thought the battle was going
to take place far from here.

1309
01:47:04,502 --> 01:47:06,003
This is too close.

1310
01:47:11,843 --> 01:47:14,344
Ani, find cover.

1311
01:47:14,429 --> 01:47:16,763
- Quick!
- Get to your ships!

1312
01:48:15,448 --> 01:48:16,656
Fighters straight ahead.

1313
01:48:16,741 --> 01:48:17,866
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1314
01:48:17,950 --> 01:48:19,242
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1315
01:48:27,919 --> 01:48:28,960
Cease fire.

1316
01:48:36,511 --> 01:48:38,970
Steady. Steady.

1317
01:49:12,046 --> 01:49:15,298
- Activate the droids.
- Yes, sir.

1318
01:49:31,816 --> 01:49:33,692
Ouch time.

1319
01:49:47,790 --> 01:49:48,957
Fire!

1320
01:50:11,189 --> 01:50:13,023
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.

1321
01:50:13,107 --> 01:50:14,608
Red group! Blue group!

1322
01:50:14,692 --> 01:50:16,526
Everybody, this way!

1323
01:50:16,611 --> 01:50:18,653
Hey, wait for me!

1324
01:50:18,738 --> 01:50:21,156
Anakin, stay where you are.
You'll be safe there.

1325
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:23,366
- But I...
- Stay in that cockpit.

1326
01:50:35,421 --> 01:50:38,715
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.

1327
01:50:58,861 --> 01:51:00,862
We gotta do something, R2.

1328
01:51:23,594 --> 01:51:26,596
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!

1329
01:51:30,101 --> 01:51:33,103
Oops, wrong one. Maybe it's this one.

1330
01:51:34,230 --> 01:51:36,606
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1331
01:51:38,776 --> 01:51:39,776
Yeah!

1332
01:51:45,116 --> 01:51:46,658
Let's go!

1333
01:51:47,702 --> 01:51:49,953
It's on automatic pilot.

1334
01:51:59,005 --> 01:52:00,964
Try to override it.

1335
01:53:01,025 --> 01:53:02,901
We don't have time for this, Captain.

1336
01:53:09,033 --> 01:53:10,909
Look, there they are.

1337
01:53:10,993 --> 01:53:13,370
That's where the autopilot's taking us.

1338
01:53:30,388 --> 01:53:33,014
Dumb droid. Take that!

1339
01:53:33,099 --> 01:53:35,100
Get off! Get off! Get off!

1340
01:53:35,184 --> 01:53:36,393
Get off!

1341
01:53:46,404 --> 01:53:48,780
The deflector shield is too strong.

1342
01:53:58,082 --> 01:53:59,791
This is tense!

1343
01:54:02,044 --> 01:54:04,087
R2, get us off this autopilot.

1344
01:54:04,171 --> 01:54:06,089
It's gonna get us both killed.

1345
01:54:07,717 --> 01:54:10,176
You did it, R2!

1346
01:54:10,261 --> 01:54:11,469
Let's go left.

1347
01:54:16,642 --> 01:54:17,851
Go back?

1348
01:54:17,935 --> 01:54:22,272
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

1349
01:54:29,113 --> 01:54:31,614
I'll try spinning. That's a good trick.

1350
01:54:37,246 --> 01:54:39,789
I know we're in trouble. Just hang on.

1351
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:47,672
Go!

1352
01:54:52,470 --> 01:54:54,262
Ascension guns!

1353
01:57:00,306 --> 01:57:01,973
Retreat! Retreat!

1354
01:57:03,726 --> 01:57:05,643
Dis is nutsen.

1355
01:57:15,487 --> 01:57:17,488
Uh-oh. Big boomers.

1356
01:57:38,218 --> 01:57:40,637
Give me a lift!

1357
01:57:47,853 --> 01:57:49,520
Jar Jar, usen da booma!

1358
01:57:49,605 --> 01:57:51,564
What? Mesa no have a booma!

1359
01:57:51,649 --> 01:57:53,650
Here. Taken dis one.

1360
01:58:10,042 --> 01:58:11,125
Jar Jar!

1361
01:58:11,210 --> 01:58:13,294
Jump, Jar Jar, jump!

1362
01:58:23,389 --> 01:58:26,182
Put down your weapons. They win this round.

1363
01:58:39,071 --> 01:58:41,322
We're hit, R2!

1364
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:57,505
I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop!

1365
01:59:04,638 --> 01:59:06,222
Everything's overheated.

1366
01:59:07,641 --> 01:59:09,684
Oops. This is not good.

1367
02:00:22,049 --> 02:00:24,300
No giben up, General Jar Jar.

1368
02:00:24,384 --> 02:00:26,260
Mesa think of something.

1369
02:00:26,345 --> 02:00:27,804
Hands up.

1370
02:00:27,888 --> 02:00:30,807
My give up. My give up.

1371
02:00:39,483 --> 02:00:42,610
Your little insurrection
is at an end, Your Highness.

1372
02:00:42,694 --> 02:00:44,654
Time for you to sign the treaty...

1373
02:00:44,738 --> 02:00:46,656
and end this pointless
debate in the senate.

1374
02:00:46,740 --> 02:00:48,533
Viceroy!

1375
02:00:48,617 --> 02:00:50,618
Your occupation here has ended.

1376
02:00:52,121 --> 02:00:55,498
After her. This one's a decoy.

1377
02:01:02,047 --> 02:01:03,589
Captain!

1378
02:01:12,850 --> 02:01:14,851
Jam the doors.

1379
02:01:18,355 --> 02:01:21,190
Now, Viceroy, we will discuss a new treaty.

1380
02:02:24,421 --> 02:02:26,923
Yes! We have power. Shields up.

1381
02:02:30,135 --> 02:02:31,260
Take this!

1382
02:02:33,222 --> 02:02:34,305
And this!

1383
02:02:42,189 --> 02:02:44,023
- Oops.
- We're losing power.

1384
02:02:44,107 --> 02:02:45,942
There seems to be a problem
with the main reactor.

1385
02:02:46,026 --> 02:02:47,443
Impossible!

1386
02:02:47,527 --> 02:02:49,445
Nothing can get through our shield.

1387
02:02:50,697 --> 02:02:52,573
Let's get outta here.

1388
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:03,251
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!

1389
02:03:06,213 --> 02:03:07,797
We didn't hit it.

1390
02:03:10,884 --> 02:03:12,969
Now, this is Podracing.

1391
02:03:14,513 --> 02:03:16,305
Look, one of ours, out of the main hold!

1392
02:03:37,661 --> 02:03:39,120
What the...

1393
02:03:39,204 --> 02:03:41,497
Was'n they doing?

1394
02:03:41,581 --> 02:03:45,167
The control ship has been destroyed. Look!

1395
02:03:46,878 --> 02:03:49,297
They all broke-ed.

1396
02:04:37,637 --> 02:04:41,057
No, it's too late.

1397
02:04:41,141 --> 02:04:43,476
- No.
- Obi-Wan.

1398
02:04:44,728 --> 02:04:46,645
Promise...

1399
02:04:46,730 --> 02:04:49,315
Promise me you will train the boy.

1400
02:04:49,399 --> 02:04:51,025
Yes, Master.

1401
02:04:55,072 --> 02:04:57,656
He is the chosen one.

1402
02:04:57,741 --> 02:05:00,993
He will bring balance.

1403
02:05:02,162 --> 02:05:03,621
Train him.

1404
02:05:31,108 --> 02:05:32,942
Now, Viceroy...

1405
02:05:33,026 --> 02:05:36,487
you're going to have to go back
to the senate and explain all this.

1406
02:05:38,198 --> 02:05:41,492
I think you can kiss
your trade franchise good-bye.

1407
02:05:55,215 --> 02:05:58,801
We are indebted to you
for your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1408
02:05:58,885 --> 02:06:00,803
And you, young Skywalker.

1409
02:06:01,555 --> 02:06:04,932
We will watch your career
with great interest.

1410
02:06:11,356 --> 02:06:13,983
Congratulations on your
election, Chancellor.

1411
02:06:14,067 --> 02:06:19,321
Your boldness has saved our people, Your Majesty.
It's you who should be congratulated.

1412
02:06:19,406 --> 02:06:24,076
Together we shall bring peace
and prosperity to the Republic.

1413
02:06:29,082 --> 02:06:33,544
Confer on you the level
of Jedi knight the council does.

1414
02:06:33,628 --> 02:06:38,382
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...

1415
02:06:38,467 --> 02:06:40,426
I do not.

1416
02:06:40,510 --> 02:06:42,553
Qui-Gon believed in him.

1417
02:06:45,515 --> 02:06:48,184
The chosen one the boy may be.

1418
02:06:48,268 --> 02:06:49,935
Nevertheless...

1419
02:06:50,020 --> 02:06:52,938
grave danger I fear in his training.

1420
02:06:53,023 --> 02:06:57,193
Master Yoda, I gave Qui-Gon my word.

1421
02:06:57,277 --> 02:06:59,236
I will train Anakin.

1422
02:07:01,448 --> 02:07:03,824
Without the approval
of the council, if I must.

1423
02:07:03,909 --> 02:07:06,452
Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you.

1424
02:07:06,536 --> 02:07:08,454
Need that you do not.

1425
02:07:10,707 --> 02:07:14,001
Agree with you the council does.

1426
02:07:15,045 --> 02:07:18,380
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.

1427
02:07:46,159 --> 02:07:47,952
What will happen to me now?

1428
02:07:48,036 --> 02:07:51,163
The council have granted me
permission to train you.

1429
02:07:51,248 --> 02:07:54,625
You will be a Jedi, I promise.

1430
02:08:04,094 --> 02:08:07,513
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.

1431
02:08:07,597 --> 02:08:10,057
Always two there are.

1432
02:08:10,141 --> 02:08:13,394
No more, no less.

1433
02:08:13,478 --> 02:08:16,438
A master and an apprentice.

1434
02:08:16,523 --> 02:08:18,107
But which was destroyed?

1435
02:08:18,191 --> 02:08:21,151
The master or the apprentice?

1436
02:08:45,802 --> 02:08:47,928
Hidoe, everybody!

1437
02:09:34,517 --> 02:09:36,477
Peace!

1438
02:16:08,828 --> 02:16:09,828
English - US

1
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,347
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

2
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:21,599
Very good, Lieutenant.

3
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,153
We made it.

4
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,325
I guess I was wrong.

5
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,660
There was no danger at all.

6
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:43,139
Cordé.

7
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:47,477
Milady, I'm so sorry.

8
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,438
I've failed you, Senator.

9
00:03:50,523 --> 00:03:51,689
No.

10
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:57,362
Milady, you're still in danger here.

11
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:07,288
- I shouldn't have come back.
- This vote is very important.

12
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:11,042
You did your duty.
Cordé did hers. Now, come.

13
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,004
Senator Amidala, please.

14
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:29,686
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.

15
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,314
More and more star systems
are joining the separatists.

16
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,275
If they do break away...

17
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:38,611
I will not let this Republic
that has stood for a thousand years...

18
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:40,780
be split in two.

19
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:44,117
My negotiations will not fail.

20
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,578
If they do, you must realize...

21
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,746
there aren't enough Jedi
to protect the Republic.

22
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:52,375
We're keepers of the peace, not soldiers.

23
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:55,545
Master Yoda...

24
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,215
do you think it will really come to war?

25
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:04,971
The dark side clouds everything.

26
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:10,059
Impossible to see the future is.

27
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:15,148
The Loyalist Committee
has arrived, Your Honor.

28
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,232
Good.

29
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,904
Send them in.

30
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,907
We will discuss this matter later.

31
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:31,956
Senator Amidala, your tragedy
on the landing platform...

32
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,125
terrible.

33
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,837
Seeing you alive brings
warm feelings to my heart.

34
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:40,673
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?

35
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:45,428
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

36
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,348
I think that Count Dooku was behind it.

37
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:52,352
He is a political idealist, not a murderer.

38
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:55,480
You know, milady, Count
Dooku was once a Jedi.

39
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:59,025
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.

40
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,694
But for certain, Senator...

41
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:05,657
in grave danger you are.

42
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:09,702
Master Jedi, may I suggest...

43
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:13,915
the senator be placed under
the protection of your graces?

44
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:17,085
Do you really think that's a wise
decision under these stressful times?

45
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,295
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe...

46
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,798
The situation is that serious?

47
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,300
No, but I do, Senator.

48
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:27,762
I realize all too well
that additional security...

49
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:31,349
might be disruptive for you...

50
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,394
but perhaps someone you're familiar with.

51
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,314
An old friend, like Master Kenobi.

52
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,650
That's possible.

53
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,528
He's just returned
from a border dispute on Ansion.

54
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,823
Do it for me, milady. Please?

55
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,325
The thought of losing you...

56
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,162
is unbearable.

57
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:57,166
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.

58
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,544
Thank you, Master Windu.

59
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:12,432
- You seem a little on edge.
- Not at all.

60
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:16,185
I haven't felt you this tense since
we fell into that nest of gundarks.

61
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,938
You fell into that nightmare, Master...

62
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:21,816
and I rescued you, remember?

63
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,985
Oh... yes.

64
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:33,494
You're sweating. Relax. Take a deep breath.

65
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,706
I haven't seen her in ten years, Master.

66
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:54,098
Obi? Obi!

67
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:57,852
- Mesa so smilen to seein yousa!
- Good to see you again, Jar Jar.

68
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,937
Senator Padmé.

69
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:03,649
Mesa palos here! Lookie, lookie, Senator.

70
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,527
Desa Jedi arriven.

71
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:13,076
It's a great pleasure
to see you again, milady.

72
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,703
It has been far too long, Master Kenobi.

73
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,456
Ani?

74
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,876
- My goodness, you've grown.
- So have you.

75
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,379
Grown more beautiful, I mean.

76
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:27,215
Well, for a senator, I mean.

77
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:32,720
Ani, you'll always be that little boy
I knew on Tatooine.

78
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,725
Our presence here will be invisible,
milady, I can assure you.

79
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,311
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.

80
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:42,480
Queen Jamillia has been informed
of your assignment.

81
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,690
I am grateful you are here, Master Kenobi.

82
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:47,568
The situation is more dangerous
than the senator will admit.

83
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:50,363
I don't need more security. I need answers.

84
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,698
I want to know who's trying to kill me.

85
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:56,661
We are here to protect you,
Senator, not to start an investigation.

86
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,122
We will find out
who's trying to kill you, Padmé.

87
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,082
I promise you.

88
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,918
We will not exceed our mandate,
my young Padawan learner.

89
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,963
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master, of course.

90
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,590
We will not go through
this exercise again, Anakin...

91
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,676
and you will pay attention to my lead.

92
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,845
- Why?
- What?

93
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:19,434
Why else do you think we were assigned
to her if not to find the killer?

94
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:22,854
Protection is a job
for local security, not Jedi.

95
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,773
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.

96
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:29,152
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.

97
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,657
And you will learn your place, young one.

98
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,204
Perhaps with merely your presence...

99
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:43,207
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.

100
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:46,085
Now, if you'll excuse me...

101
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,879
I will retire.

102
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,257
I know I'll feel better having you here.

103
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,009
I'll have an officer stationed
on every floor...

104
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,845
and I'll be in the control
center downstairs.

105
00:09:57,473 --> 00:10:00,475
Mesa busten wit happiness
seein yousa again, Ani.

106
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,728
She hardly even recognized me, Jar Jar.

107
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,316
I've thought about her
every day since we parted...

108
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,611
and she's forgotten me completely.

109
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:15,907
Shesa happy.
Happier den mesa seein her in a longo time.

110
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:19,994
You're focusing on the negative, Anakin.
Be mindful of your thoughts.

111
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,580
She was pleased to see us.

112
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,665
Now, let's check the security.

113
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,760
I hit the ship, but they used a decoy.

114
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,137
We'll have to try something
more subtle this time, Zam.

115
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:40,223
My client is getting impatient.

116
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,184
Take these. Be careful.
They're very poisonous.

117
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:46,729
And, Zam, there can be
no mistakes this time.

118
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,485
Captain Typho has
more than enough men downstairs.

119
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,570
No assassin would try that way.

120
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,698
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.

121
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:02,328
I don't like just waiting here
for something to happen to her.

122
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,706
- What's going on?
- She covered the cameras.

123
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,459
I don't think she liked me watching her.

124
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,461
What is she thinking?

125
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:13,548
She programmed R2 to warn us
if there is an intruder.

126
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:16,259
There are many other
ways to kill a senator.

127
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:20,763
I know, but we also want to catch
this assassin, don't we, Master?

128
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,934
You're using her as bait.

129
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,144
It was her idea.

130
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:29,814
Don't worry. No harm will come to her.

131
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,858
I can sense everything
going on in that room.

132
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:35,236
Trust me.

133
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,655
It's too risky.

134
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:41,242
Besides, your senses aren't that attuned,
my young apprentice.

135
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,411
And yours are?

136
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:47,456
Possibly.

137
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,806
You look tired.

138
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,475
I don't sleep well anymore.

139
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,145
Because of your mother?

140
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:17,111
I don't know why I keep dreaming about her.

141
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,782
Dreams pass in time.

142
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,870
I'd much rather dream about Padmé.

143
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:30,207
Just being around her again is...
intoxicating.

144
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,752
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.
They betray you.

145
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,212
You've made a commitment
to the Jedi order...

146
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,381
a commitment not easily broken.

147
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:40,217
And don't forget, she's a politician.
They're not to be trusted.

148
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,928
She's not like the others
in the senate, Master.

149
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,222
It is my experience that senators focus...

150
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:48,184
only on pleasing those
who fund their campaigns...

151
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:52,480
and they're in no means scared of
forgetting the niceties of democracy...

152
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,774
- in order to get those funds.
- Not another lecture.

153
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,693
At least not on the economics of politics.

154
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,043
And besides, you're generalizing.

155
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:58,212
The chancellor doesn't
appear to be corrupt.

156
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,964
Palpatine is a politician.

157
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,717
I have observed that he is very clever...

158
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:06,804
in following the passions
and the prejudices of the senators.

159
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,806
I think he's a good man...

160
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,808
I sense it too.

161
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,994
Stay here!

162
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,331
Are you all right, milady?

163
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:09,992
What the...

164
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,336
Jedi poo doo!

165
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,441
- What took you so long?
- Oh, you know, Master.

166
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:27,444
- I couldn't find a speeder I liked...
- There he is.

167
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:30,906
with the open cockpit
and the right speed capabilities.

168
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:33,826
If you spent as long practicing your
saber techniques as you do your wit...

169
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,661
you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.

170
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,454
I thought I already did.

171
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:40,291
Only in your mind, my
very young apprentice.

172
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:11,238
Pull up, Anakin. Pull up!

173
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,497
You know I don't like it when you do that.

174
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:23,792
Sorry, Master.
I forgot you don't like flying.

175
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,754
I don't mind flying,
but what you're doing is suicide!

176
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,993
Anakin! How many times have I told you...

177
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,287
stay away from power couplings!

178
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,333
That was good!

179
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:22,434
Where are you going? He went that way.

180
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,561
Master, if we keep this chase
going any longer...

181
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,647
that creep is gonna end up deep-fried...

182
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:31,068
and, personally, I'd like to find out
who he is and who he's working for.

183
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,862
This is a shortcut... I think.

184
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,517
Well, you've lost him.

185
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,103
I'm deeply sorry, Master.

186
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,105
That was some shortcut, Anakin.

187
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,607
He went completely the other way.

188
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,776
- Once again you've proved...
- If you'll excuse me.

189
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,906
I hate it when he does that.

190
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,682
Anakin!

191
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:51,643
- She went into the club, Master.
- Patience.

192
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:54,730
- Use the Force. Think.
- Sorry, Master.

193
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:58,108
- He went in there to hide, not to run.
- Yes, Master.

194
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:01,028
- Next time, try not to lose it.
- Yes, Master.

195
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:05,073
- This weapon is your life.
- I try, Master.

196
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,868
Why do I get the feeling
you're going to be the death of me?

197
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,661
Don't say that, Master.

198
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,830
You're the closest thing
I have to a father.

199
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:13,832
Then why don't you listen to me?

200
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:15,542
I am trying.

201
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:29,556
Can you see him?

202
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:31,642
I think he is a she...

203
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:34,436
and I think she is a changeling.

204
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,648
In that case, be extra careful.

205
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:42,110
- Go and find her.
- Where are you going, Master?

206
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,737
For a drink.

207
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,124
Thank you.

208
00:22:57,293 --> 00:23:00,337
- You wanna buy some death sticks?
- You don't want to sell me death sticks.

209
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,089
I don't want to sell you death sticks.

210
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:03,924
You want to go home and rethink your life.

211
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,301
I want to go home and rethink my life.

212
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,476
Easy.

213
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:58,729
Jedi business. Go back to your drinks.

214
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:08,030
Do you know who it was
you were trying to kill?

215
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,407
It was a senator from Naboo.

216
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:13,201
- And who hired you?
- It was just a job.

217
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:16,580
Who hired you? Tell us.

218
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,083
Tell us now!

219
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:22,878
It was a bounty hunter called...

220
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:32,679
Wee shahnit... sleemo.

221
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,066
Toxic dart.

222
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:58,538
Track down this bounty hunter
you must, Obi-Wan.

223
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:02,084
Most importantly,
find out who he's working for.

224
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:06,088
What about Senator Amidala?
She will still need protecting.

225
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:09,132
Handle that your Padawan will.

226
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:14,513
Anakin, escort the senator
back to her home planet of Naboo.

227
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:18,350
She'll be safer there.
And don't use registered transport.

228
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,435
Travel as refugees.

229
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,480
As the leader of the opposition,
it will be very difficult...

230
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,941
to get Senator Amidala
to leave the capital.

231
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:29,736
Until caught this killer is...

232
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:33,240
our judgment she must respect.

233
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:35,450
Anakin, go to the senate...

234
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:38,787
and ask Chancellor Palpatine
to speak with her about this matter.

235
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,589
I will talk with her.

236
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:52,843
Senator Amidala will not refuse
an executive order.

237
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:55,095
I know her well enough
to assure you of that.

238
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,264
Thank you, Your Excellency.

239
00:25:57,348 --> 00:26:00,767
And so, they've finally
given you an assignment.

240
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:03,854
Your patience has paid off.

241
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:06,314
Your guidance more than my patience.

242
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,818
You don't need guidance, Anakin.

243
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:14,156
In time, you will learn
to trust your feelings.

244
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:18,160
Then you will be invincible.

245
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:23,206
I have said it many times:

246
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:26,084
You are the most gifted
Jedi I have ever met.

247
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:28,086
Thank you, Your Excellency.

248
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:31,882
I see you becoming the greatest
of all the Jedi, Anakin...

249
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:34,509
even more powerful than Master Yoda.

250
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,725
I am concerned for my Padawan.

251
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:44,561
He is not ready to be given
this assignment on his own yet.

252
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:47,898
The council is confident
in its decision, Obi-Wan.

253
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:49,941
The boy has exceptional skills.

254
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:52,486
But he still has much to learn, Master.

255
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:56,072
His abilities have made
him, well, arrogant.

256
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:58,116
Yes.

257
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:01,203
A flaw more and more common among Jedi.

258
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,665
Too sure of themselves they are.

259
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,211
Even the older, more experienced ones.

260
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:12,923
Remember, Obi-Wan, if
the prophecy is true...

261
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:16,676
your apprentice is the only one who can
bring the Force back into balance.

262
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:23,600
I'm taking an extended leave of absence.

263
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:26,811
It will be your responsibility
to take my place in the senate.

264
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:29,814
Representative Binks,
I know I can count on you.

265
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:34,694
Mesa honored to be taking on
dissa heavy burden.

266
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:39,074
Mesa accept this with muy,
muy humility and...

267
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,785
Jar Jar, I don't wish to hold you up.

268
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,828
I'm sure you have a great deal to do.

269
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:45,956
Of course.

270
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,624
Milady.

271
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:54,089
I do not like this idea of hiding.

272
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:56,299
Don't worry.

273
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:58,635
Now that the council
has ordered an investigation...

274
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:01,388
it won't take Master Obi-Wan long
to find this bounty hunter.

275
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:04,391
I haven't worked for a year
to defeat the Military Creation Act...

276
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,560
to not be here when its fate is decided.

277
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,728
Sometimes we must let go of our pride...

278
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:10,772
and do what is requested of us.

279
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,942
Anakin, you've grown up.

280
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:18,280
Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it.

281
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:29,666
Don't get me wrong.
Obi-Wan is a great mentor.

282
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,335
As wise as Master Yoda and...

283
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,588
as powerful as Master Windu.

284
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,342
I am truly thankful to be his apprentice.

285
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,598
In some ways... a lot of ways...

286
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:48,602
I'm really ahead of him.

287
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:51,146
I'm ready for the trials...

288
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,691
but he feels that I'm too unpredictable.

289
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,693
He won't let me move on.

290
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:59,863
- That must be frustrating.
- It's worse.

291
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,741
He's overly critical. He never listens.

292
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:05,201
He doesn't understand.

293
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:07,412
It's not fair!

294
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:12,375
All mentors have a way of seeing
more of our faults than we would like.

295
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,502
It's the only way we grow.

296
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:18,006
I know.

297
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,009
Anakin...

298
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:25,847
don't try to grow up too fast.

299
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,016
But I am grown up.

300
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:32,062
You said it yourself.

301
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:35,315
Please don't look at me like that.

302
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,734
Why not?

303
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:40,028
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

304
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:43,990
Sorry, milady.

305
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:02,008
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.

306
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:05,178
Take good care of Dormé.
The threat's on you two now.

307
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:07,263
He'll be safe with me.

308
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:13,311
You'll be fine.

309
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:16,648
It's not me, milady. I worry about you.

310
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,067
What if they realize
you've left the capital?

311
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:23,530
Well, then my Jedi protector
will have to prove how good he is.

312
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:25,532
Anakin...

313
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:28,743
don't do anything without first
consulting either myself or the council.

314
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,787
Yes, Master.

315
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:34,499
I'll get to the bottom
of this plot quickly, milady.

316
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,501
You'll be back here in no time.

317
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,838
I'll be most grateful
for your speed, Master Jedi.

318
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:41,840
- It's time to go.
- I know.

319
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:44,509
Anakin, may the Force be with you.

320
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,636
May the Force be with you, Master.

321
00:30:58,107 --> 00:30:59,983
Suddenly I'm afraid.

322
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:03,737
This is my first assignment on my own.
I am too.

323
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:08,283
Don't worry. We have R2 with us.

324
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:16,166
I do hope he doesn't try anything foolish.

325
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:20,420
I'd be more concerned about her
doing something than him.

326
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:44,235
Someone to see ya, honey!

327
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,279
Jedi, by the looks of him.

328
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,948
Obi-Wan!

329
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:51,284
Hello, Dex.

330
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:53,995
Take a seat. I'll be right with ya.

331
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:59,375
- You wanna cup o' jawa juice?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

332
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:06,216
Old buddy!

333
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:18,561
So, my friend, what can I do for ya?

334
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,522
You can tell me what this is.

335
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:25,235
Well, whattaya know!

336
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:27,695
I ain't seen one of these
since I was prospectin'...

337
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,074
on Subterrel, beyond the outer rim.

338
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,618
Can you tell me where it came from?

339
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:36,663
This baby belongs to them cloners.

340
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:41,084
What you got here is a Kamino saberdart.

341
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:44,170
I wonder why it didn't show up
in the analysis archives.

342
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:47,590
It's these funny little cuts on the side
that give it away.

343
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:51,636
Those analysis droids
only focus on symbols.

344
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,972
I should think that you Jedi
would have more respect...

345
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:56,432
for the difference between knowledge and...

346
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,269
wisdom.

347
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:01,062
Well, if droids could think...

348
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,064
there'd be none of us here, would there?

349
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:06,484
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?

350
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:08,528
No, no. It's beyond the outer rim.

351
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:14,033
I'd say about 12 parsecs
outside the Rishi Maze.

352
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:18,913
Should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your archives.

353
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:24,627
These Kaminoans keep to themselves.

354
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:27,589
They're cloners. Damn good ones too.

355
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:32,176
- Cloners. Are they friendly?
- Depends.

356
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:34,178
Depends on what, Dex?

357
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:37,181
On how good your manners are...

358
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:41,603
and how big your... pocketbook is.

359
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:54,991
- Did you call for assistance?
- Yes, I did.

360
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:57,243
Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?

361
00:33:57,328 --> 00:34:00,663
Yes, I'm looking for a planetary system
called Kamino.

362
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:03,041
It doesn't show up on the archive charts.

363
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:07,420
Kamino. It's not a system
I'm familiar with.

364
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,881
Are you sure you have
the right coordinates?

365
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:13,009
According to my information, it should
appear in this quadrant here...

366
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:15,178
just south of the Rishi Maze.

367
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:25,438
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for...

368
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:27,231
doesn't exist.

369
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:30,860
Impossible.
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.

370
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:34,030
If an item does not
appear in our records...

371
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:36,199
it does not exist.

372
00:34:57,888 --> 00:35:00,473
Hey, you! No droids!

373
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,517
Get outta here!

374
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:11,192
Thank you, R2.

375
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:14,904
Must be difficult,
having sworn your life to the Jedi...

376
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:18,908
not being able to visit the places
you like or do the things you like.

377
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:21,160
Or be with the people that I love.

378
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:24,122
Are you allowed to love?

379
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,040
I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.

380
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:31,879
Attachment is forbidden.

381
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:35,591
Possession is forbidden.

382
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:39,262
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love...

383
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,848
is central to a Jedi's life.

384
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:48,646
So you might say that
we are encouraged to love.

385
00:35:48,731 --> 00:35:50,690
You've changed so much.

386
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,359
You haven't changed a bit.

387
00:35:53,444 --> 00:35:56,362
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.

388
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:12,712
Reach out. Sense the Force around you.

389
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,548
Use your feelings you must.

390
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:22,972
Younglings. Younglings!

391
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:25,475
A visitor we have.

392
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:28,478
Hello, Master Obi-Wan.

393
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:30,021
Hello.

394
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,647
I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.

395
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:34,108
What help can I be, Obi-Wan?

396
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,446
I'm looking for a planet
described to me by an old friend.

397
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,741
I trust him, but the systems don't show
on the archive maps.

398
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:46,162
Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has.

399
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:50,291
How embarrassing. How embarrassing!

400
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:53,669
Liam, the shades.

401
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:57,507
Gather round the map reader.

402
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:59,550
Clear your minds...

403
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:03,346
and find Obi-Wan's wayward planet we will.

404
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:07,725
It ought to be here...

405
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,727
but it isn't.

406
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:13,272
Gravity is pulling all the stars
in the area towards this spot.

407
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:16,943
Gravity's silhouette remains...

408
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:20,029
but the star and all the planets...

409
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:22,115
disappeared they have.

410
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,367
How can this be?

411
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:27,203
A thought?

412
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,373
Anyone.

413
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:31,874
Master?

414
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:34,877
Because someone erased it
from the archive memory.

415
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:42,135
Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.

416
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,223
The Padawan is right.

417
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:50,393
Go to the center of gravity's pull...

418
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:54,021
and find your planet you will.

419
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:02,738
The data must have been erased.

420
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:07,577
But who could empty information from
the archives? Isn't that impossible?

421
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:11,080
Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is.

422
00:38:11,165 --> 00:38:15,585
Only a Jedi could have erased those files.

423
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:19,088
But who and why, harder to answer.

424
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:23,050
Meditate on this I will.

425
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:50,161
I wasn't the youngest queen ever elected...

426
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:53,873
but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.

427
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,958
I'm not sure I was ready.

428
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:58,878
The people you served
thought you did a good job.

429
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,047
I heard they even tried
to amend the constitution...

430
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:03,216
so you could stay in office.

431
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,801
I was relieved when my two terms were up.

432
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:09,639
But when the queen asked me
to serve as senator...

433
00:39:09,723 --> 00:39:11,891
I couldn't refuse her.

434
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:15,394
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.

435
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:19,607
I'm glad that you chose to serve.

436
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:30,201
If the senate votes to create an army,
it's sure to push us into a civil war.

437
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,119
It's unthinkable!

438
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:35,623
There hasn't been a full-scale war
since the formation of the Republic.

439
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,209
Do you see any way through negotiations...

440
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,419
to bring the separatists
back into the Republic?

441
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:42,713
Not if they feel threatened.

442
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:46,217
They'll turn to the Trade Federations
or the Commerce Guilds for help.

443
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,261
It's outrageous...

444
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:50,680
but after four trials
in the Supreme Court...

445
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:54,558
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy
of the Trade Federation.

446
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:58,688
I fear the senate is powerless
to resolve this crisis.

447
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:02,984
We must keep our faith in the Republic.

448
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:13,911
The day we stop believing democracy
can work is the day we lose it.

449
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:16,747
Let's pray that day never comes.

450
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:19,500
In the meantime,
we must consider your own safety.

451
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,586
What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?

452
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:26,090
Anakin's not a Jedi yet.
He's still a Padawan learner.

453
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:28,050
- But I was thinking...
- Hold on a minute.

454
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:29,427
Excuse me.

455
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:31,929
I was thinking I would stay
in the lake country.

456
00:40:32,014 --> 00:40:34,140
There are some places up there
that are very isolated.

457
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:37,476
Excuse me. I'm in charge
of security here, milady.

458
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:41,188
And this is my home. I know it very well.
That is why we're here.

459
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:43,274
I think it would be wise...

460
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,818
if you took advantage
of my knowledge in this instance.

461
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:49,071
Sorry, milady.

462
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:54,410
Perfect. It's settled, then.

463
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:11,135
There it is, R4, right where it should be.

464
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,054
Our missing planet Kamino.

465
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:53,094
Master Jedi.

466
00:41:54,054 --> 00:41:56,597
The prime minister is expecting you.

467
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,226
- I'm expected?
- Of course.

468
00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:03,354
He is anxious to meet you.

469
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,648
After all these years...

470
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:09,360
we were beginning to think
you weren't coming.

471
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,737
Now, please, this way.

472
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:27,002
May I present Lama Su...

473
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:29,130
prime minister of Kamino.

474
00:42:30,841 --> 00:42:33,050
And this is Master Jedi...

475
00:42:33,135 --> 00:42:35,052
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

476
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:38,472
I trust you're going to enjoy your stay.

477
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:41,934
Please.

478
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,729
And now to business.

479
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:49,817
You will be delighted to hear
that we are on schedule.

480
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:52,778
200,000 units are ready...

481
00:42:52,863 --> 00:42:55,281
with a million more well on the way.

482
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,325
That's good news.

483
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:01,579
Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas...

484
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:05,040
that his order will be met on time.

485
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:07,168
I'm sorry. Master...

486
00:43:08,295 --> 00:43:10,880
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still...

487
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:14,091
a leading member of the Jedi Council,
is he not?

488
00:43:14,176 --> 00:43:18,012
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed
almost ten years ago.

489
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,974
I'm so sorry to hear that.

490
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:26,353
But I'm sure he would have been proud
of the army we've built for him.

491
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:28,814
The army?

492
00:43:28,899 --> 00:43:32,610
Yes, a clone army, and I must say...

493
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:34,904
one of the finest we've ever created.

494
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:36,989
Tell me, Prime Minister...

495
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:39,617
when my master first contacted you
about the army...

496
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:41,827
did he say who it was for?

497
00:43:41,912 --> 00:43:43,954
Of course he did.

498
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:46,749
This army is for the Republic.

499
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:51,212
But you must be anxious
to inspect the units for yourself.

500
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:54,882
That's why I'm here.

501
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,863
We used to come here for school retreat.

502
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,700
We would swim to that island every day.

503
00:44:22,953 --> 00:44:24,954
I love the water.

504
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:33,712
We used to lie out on the sand
and let the sun dry us...

505
00:44:33,797 --> 00:44:36,799
and try to guess the names
of the birds singing.

506
00:44:39,636 --> 00:44:41,720
I don't like sand.

507
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:46,392
It's coarse and rough and irritating...

508
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:48,561
and it gets everywhere.

509
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:52,773
Not like here.

510
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,401
Here, everything is soft...

511
00:44:57,404 --> 00:44:59,738
and smooth.

512
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:37,985
No.

513
00:45:38,612 --> 00:45:40,654
I shouldn't have done that.

514
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:44,366
I'm sorry.

515
00:45:57,964 --> 00:45:59,590
Very impressive.

516
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,842
I'd hoped you would be pleased.

517
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:07,473
Clones can think creatively.

518
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:11,518
You will find that they are
immensely superior to droids.

519
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:20,653
We take great pride in our combat
education and training programs.

520
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:24,114
This group was created
about five years ago.

521
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:26,283
You mentioned growth acceleration.

522
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:28,327
Oh, yes, it's essential.

523
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:31,455
Otherwise, a mature clone
would take a lifetime to grow.

524
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:34,166
Now we can do it in half the time.

525
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,960
I see.

526
00:46:37,045 --> 00:46:38,962
They are totally obedient...

527
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:41,757
taking any order without question.

528
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:43,926
We modified their genetic structure...

529
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,221
to make them less independent
than the original host.

530
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,807
And who was the original host?

531
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:52,101
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.

532
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,688
And where is this bounty hunter now?

533
00:46:55,772 --> 00:46:58,065
Oh, we keep him here.

534
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:03,529
Apart from his pay, which
is considerable...

535
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:06,156
Fett demanded only one thing:

536
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:08,826
an unaltered clone for himself.

537
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,370
- Curious, isn't it?
- "Unaltered"?

538
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:13,997
Pure genetic replication.

539
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:17,292
No tampering with the structure
to make it more docile...

540
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:19,920
and no growth acceleration.

541
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:23,340
I should very much like
to meet this Jango Fett.

542
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:26,719
I would be very happy
to arrange it for you.

543
00:47:44,237 --> 00:47:47,114
Magnificent, aren't they?

544
00:47:53,163 --> 00:47:55,080
I don't know.

545
00:47:56,124 --> 00:47:58,417
Sure you do.
You just don't want to tell me.

546
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,878
You gonna use one of your
Jedi mind tricks on me?

547
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:03,130
They only work on the weak-minded.

548
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:06,175
All right.

549
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:08,427
I was 12. His name was Palo.

550
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:11,054
We were both in the
Legislative Youth Program.

551
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:14,099
He was a few years older than I. Very cute.

552
00:48:14,184 --> 00:48:16,685
Dark, curly hair. Dreamy eyes.

553
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:19,062
All right, I get the picture.

554
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:21,064
Whatever happened to him?

555
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:23,901
I went into public service.
He went on to become an artist.

556
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:26,069
Maybe he was the smart one.

557
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:28,405
You really don't like politicians, do you?

558
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:30,699
I like two or three...

559
00:48:30,784 --> 00:48:32,868
but I'm not really sure about one of them.

560
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:39,082
I don't think the system works.

561
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,794
How would you have it work?

562
00:48:42,295 --> 00:48:46,423
We need a system where the politicians
sit down and discuss the problem...

563
00:48:46,508 --> 00:48:49,092
agree what's in the best interest
of all the people...

564
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:50,928
and then do it.

565
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:52,930
That's exactly what we do.

566
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:55,015
The trouble is that people
don't always agree.

567
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,017
Well, then they should be made to.

568
00:48:57,101 --> 00:49:00,229
- By whom? Who's gonna make them?
- I don't know. Someone.

569
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:02,397
- You?
- Of course not me.

570
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:05,442
- But someone.
- Someone wise.

571
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:09,363
Sounds an awful lot like
a dictatorship to me.

572
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:13,158
Well, if it works.

573
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:22,000
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

574
00:49:22,085 --> 00:49:24,711
I'd be much too frightened
to tease a senator.

575
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:06,253
Ani, are you all right?

576
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:45,626
Boba, is your father here?

577
00:50:46,628 --> 00:50:47,669
Yep.

578
00:50:47,754 --> 00:50:49,838
May we see him?

579
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:52,799
Sure.

580
00:50:54,302 --> 00:50:56,511
Dad, Taun We's here.

581
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:12,402
Jango, welcome back.

582
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:14,404
Was your trip productive?

583
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:16,448
Fairly.

584
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:20,410
This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.

585
00:51:20,495 --> 00:51:23,538
He's come to check on our progress.

586
00:51:23,623 --> 00:51:26,500
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.

587
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:29,628
I'm just a simple man trying
to make my way in the universe.

588
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:33,465
Ever made your way as far
into the interior as Coruscant?

589
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:36,468
- Once or twice.
- Recently?

590
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,097
Possibly.

591
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:42,516
Then you must know Master Sifo-Dyas.

592
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,147
Boba, rood eht so-heeck.

593
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:51,733
Master who?

594
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:55,779
Sifo-Dyas.

595
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:58,532
Is he not the Jedi who
hired you for this job?

596
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:03,370
Never heard of him.

597
00:52:06,249 --> 00:52:07,374
Really?

598
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:12,462
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus
on one of the moons of Bogden.

599
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:14,214
Curious.

600
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:20,512
Do you like your army?

601
00:52:21,264 --> 00:52:23,265
I look forward to seeing them in action.

602
00:52:24,517 --> 00:52:27,894
They'll do their job well.
I'll guarantee that.

603
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:30,188
Thank you for your time, Jango.

604
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,067
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

605
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:55,714
What is it, Dad?

606
00:52:56,883 --> 00:52:59,092
Pack your things. We're leaving.

607
00:53:03,765 --> 00:53:08,310
And when I got to them,
we went into aggressive negotiations.

608
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,437
"Aggressive negotiations"? What's that?

609
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:14,066
Well, negotiations with a lightsaber.

610
00:53:26,996 --> 00:53:30,165
If Master Obi-Wan caught me
doing this, he'd be very grumpy.

611
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:01,780
From the moment I met you...

612
00:54:02,824 --> 00:54:05,367
all those years ago...

613
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:08,495
not a day has gone by
when I haven't thought of you.

614
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:13,625
And now that I'm with you again...

615
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:16,336
I'm in agony.

616
00:54:19,632 --> 00:54:23,593
The closer I get to you, the worse it gets.

617
00:54:23,678 --> 00:54:26,179
The thought of not being with you...

618
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:28,974
I can't breathe.

619
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:34,729
I'm haunted by the kiss...

620
00:54:34,814 --> 00:54:38,150
that you should never have given me.

621
00:54:38,234 --> 00:54:40,610
My heart is beating...

622
00:54:40,695 --> 00:54:43,655
hoping that that kiss
will not become a scar.

623
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:48,743
You are in my very soul...

624
00:54:48,828 --> 00:54:50,871
tormenting me.

625
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:56,877
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.

626
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:11,391
If you are suffering
as much as I am, please, tell me.

627
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:15,187
I can't.

628
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:19,316
We can't. It's... just not possible.

629
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,402
Anything is possible, Padmé. Listen to me.

630
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,571
No, you listen.

631
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:28,825
We live in a real world. Come back to it.

632
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:32,579
You're studying to become a Jedi.
I'm a senator.

633
00:55:34,457 --> 00:55:36,958
If you follow your thoughts
through to conclusion...

634
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:39,586
it'll take us to a place we cannot go...

635
00:55:40,713 --> 00:55:43,048
regardless of the way
we feel about each other.

636
00:55:43,132 --> 00:55:45,175
Then you do feel something.

637
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:48,345
I will not let you give
up your future for me.

638
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:50,597
You are asking me to be rational.

639
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:53,975
That is something I know I cannot do.

640
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:58,730
Believe me, I wish that
I could just wish away my feelings...

641
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:00,899
but I can't.

642
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:04,569
I will not give in to this.

643
00:56:11,619 --> 00:56:13,870
Well, you know...

644
00:56:13,955 --> 00:56:16,790
it wouldn't have to be that way.

645
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:19,793
We could keep it a secret.

646
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,213
We'd be living a lie...

647
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:25,632
one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to.

648
00:56:26,676 --> 00:56:29,010
I couldn't do that.

649
00:56:29,095 --> 00:56:31,972
Could you, Anakin?
Could you live like that?

650
00:56:33,933 --> 00:56:36,977
No. You're right.

651
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:40,438
It would destroy us.

652
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:52,075
Tell your council that
the first battalions are ready.

653
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:55,287
And remind them, if they
need more troops...

654
00:56:55,371 --> 00:56:58,540
it will take more time to grow them.

655
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:00,417
I won't forget, and thank you.

656
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:02,377
Thank you.

657
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:20,770
R4!

658
00:57:20,855 --> 00:57:24,190
Scramble code five to Coruscant,
care of the old folks' home!

659
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:34,075
I have successfully made contact
with the prime minister of Kamino.

660
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,079
They are using a bounty hunter named
Jango Fett to create a clone army.

661
00:57:38,164 --> 00:57:40,665
I have a strong feeling
that this bounty hunter...

662
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:42,876
is the assassin we are looking for.

663
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,961
Do you think these cloners are involved...

664
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:47,130
in the plot to assassinate Senator Amidala?

665
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:50,133
No, Master. There appears to be no motive.

666
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:53,136
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan.

667
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,264
Clear your mind must be...

668
00:57:56,349 --> 00:58:00,518
if you are to discover
the real villains behind this plot.

669
00:58:00,603 --> 00:58:02,479
Yes, Master.

670
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:05,648
They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed
an order for a clone army...

671
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:09,402
at the request of the senate
almost ten years ago.

672
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:15,075
I was under the impression
he was killed before that.

673
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:18,703
Did the council ever authorize
the creation of a clone army?

674
00:58:18,788 --> 00:58:20,705
No. Whoever placed that order...

675
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:23,083
did not have the authorization
of the Jedi Council.

676
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:26,878
Bring him here. Question him we will.

677
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:31,091
Yes, Master.
I will report back when I have him.

678
00:58:32,593 --> 00:58:38,598
Blind we are if creation of this clone army
we could not see.

679
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:44,145
I think it is time we
informed the senate...

680
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,272
that our ability to use
the Force has diminished.

681
00:58:47,108 --> 00:58:51,528
Only the dark lord of the Sith
knows of our weakness.

682
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:53,863
If informed the senate is...

683
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:56,449
multiply our adversaries will.

684
00:58:58,077 --> 00:58:59,744
No.

685
00:59:01,122 --> 00:59:03,039
Anakin! Help me!

686
00:59:03,124 --> 00:59:05,500
- Mom, no.
- Anakin!

687
00:59:33,696 --> 00:59:35,989
Don't go.

688
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:39,993
I don't want to disturb you.

689
00:59:41,162 --> 00:59:43,288
Your presence is soothing.

690
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,293
You had another nightmare last night.

691
00:59:49,462 --> 00:59:51,838
Jedi don't have nightmares.

692
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:54,382
I heard you.

693
00:59:59,305 --> 01:00:01,347
I saw my mother.

694
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:06,394
She is suffering, Padmé.

695
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:12,066
I saw her as clearly as I see you now.

696
01:00:23,329 --> 01:00:25,914
She is in pain.

697
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:30,376
I know I'm disobeying my mandate
to protect you, Senator...

698
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:32,504
but I have to go.

699
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:37,467
I have to help her.

700
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:41,095
I'll go with you.

701
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,473
I'm sorry. I don't have a choice.

702
01:00:54,527 --> 01:00:56,361
Dad, look!

703
01:00:57,029 --> 01:00:59,531
Boba, get on board!

704
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:17,483
Oh, not good.

705
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:28,489
Wait right there.

706
01:04:28,574 --> 01:04:30,616
Okey-okey.

707
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:34,662
Chut-chut, Watto.

708
01:04:36,707 --> 01:04:38,958
Let me help you with that.

709
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:43,379
What? What do you want?

710
01:04:43,464 --> 01:04:45,965
Wait! You're a Jedi!

711
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:49,302
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

712
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:57,143
I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

713
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:01,564
Ani?

714
01:05:03,442 --> 01:05:05,276
Little Ani?

715
01:05:08,155 --> 01:05:10,156
Nahhh.

716
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:14,660
You are Ani! It is you!

717
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:19,332
You sure sprouted, huh?

718
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:22,668
A Jedi! Whattaya know!

719
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:29,842
Maybe you could help with some
deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.

720
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:31,427
My mother.

721
01:05:31,512 --> 01:05:34,013
Oh, yeah. Shmi.

722
01:05:35,474 --> 01:05:38,726
She's not mine-a no more-a. I sold her.

723
01:05:38,811 --> 01:05:41,145
- You sold her?
- Years ago.

724
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:44,357
Sorry, Ani, but you know,
business is business.

725
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:49,237
I sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars.

726
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:51,364
At least I think it was Lars.

727
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:54,992
Believe it or not, I heard
he freed her and married her!

728
01:05:55,077 --> 01:05:57,370
Can ya beat that, eh?

729
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,999
Do you know where they are now?

730
01:06:02,918 --> 01:06:04,961
Long way from here.

731
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:09,549
Someplace over on the other side
of Mos Eisley, I think.

732
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:11,717
I'd like to know.

733
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:16,097
Sure. Absolutely!

734
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,225
Let's go look at my records, huh?

735
01:06:47,588 --> 01:06:50,673
Dad! I think we're being tracked!

736
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:54,218
He must have put a homing
device on our hull.

737
01:06:54,303 --> 01:06:56,596
Hang on, son.
We'll move into the asteroid field...

738
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,557
and we'll have a couple
of surprises for him.

739
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,528
Seismic charges!

740
01:07:12,613 --> 01:07:13,988
Stand by.

741
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:41,974
He doesn't seem to take a hint, this guy.

742
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:01,827
Watch out!

743
01:08:21,515 --> 01:08:24,350
Get him, Dad! Fire!

744
01:08:26,186 --> 01:08:28,813
Blast! This is why I hate flying!

745
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:50,334
We got him!

746
01:08:50,419 --> 01:08:52,503
We'll just have to finish him.

747
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:21,949
R4, prepare to jettison
the spare part canisters.

748
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:27,830
Fire them now!

749
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:43,387
We won't be seeing him again.

750
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:19,924
Well, R4, I think we've waited long enough.

751
01:10:40,487 --> 01:10:44,448
There's an unusual concentration
of Federation ships over there, R4.

752
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:22,486
Stay with the ship, R2.

753
01:11:37,085 --> 01:11:41,005
Hello. How might I be of service? I am C...

754
01:11:41,089 --> 01:11:43,007
3PO?

755
01:11:44,843 --> 01:11:46,719
The maker!

756
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:48,470
Master Ani!

757
01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:51,390
I knew you would return. I knew it!

758
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:53,225
And Miss Padmé. Oh, my.

759
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:54,935
Hello, 3PO.

760
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:58,939
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.

761
01:11:59,024 --> 01:12:01,066
I've come to see my mother.

762
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,904
I think perhaps we'd better go indoors.

763
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:12,369
Master Owen, might I present
two most important visitors.

764
01:12:12,454 --> 01:12:14,788
I'm Anakin Skywalker.

765
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:17,666
Owen Lars.

766
01:12:17,751 --> 01:12:19,960
- This is my girlfriend, Beru.
- Hello.

767
01:12:20,045 --> 01:12:22,338
I'm Padmé.

768
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:24,840
I guess I'm your stepbrother.

769
01:12:24,925 --> 01:12:27,843
I had a feeling you might show up someday.

770
01:12:28,929 --> 01:12:30,387
Is my mother here?

771
01:12:30,472 --> 01:12:32,223
No, she's not.

772
01:12:33,225 --> 01:12:35,100
Cliegg Lars.

773
01:12:35,185 --> 01:12:37,269
Shmi is my wife.

774
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:41,357
We should go inside.
We have a lot to talk about.

775
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:52,034
It was just before dawn.
They came out of nowhere.

776
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:55,079
A hunting party of Tusken Raiders.

777
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:58,958
Your mother had gone out early,
like she always did...

778
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:02,461
to pick mushrooms that
grow on the vaporators.

779
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:06,715
From the tracks, she was
about halfway home...

780
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,759
when they took her.

781
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:12,388
Those Tuskens walk like men...

782
01:13:12,472 --> 01:13:17,142
but they're vicious, mindless monsters.

783
01:13:18,812 --> 01:13:21,981
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.

784
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:27,069
I'd be out there with them,
but after I lost my leg...

785
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:32,825
I just couldn't ride anymore until I heal.

786
01:13:33,368 --> 01:13:35,661
I don't want to give up on her...

787
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:38,622
but she's been gone a month.

788
01:13:38,707 --> 01:13:41,750
There's little hope she's lasted this long.

789
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:48,882
Where are you going?

790
01:13:48,967 --> 01:13:51,010
To find my mother.

791
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:55,097
Your mother's dead, son. Accept it.

792
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:20,247
You're gonna have to stay here.

793
01:14:20,332 --> 01:14:23,042
These are good people, Padmé.
You'll be safe.

794
01:14:35,555 --> 01:14:37,639
I won't be long.

795
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:28,584
We must persuade the Commerce Guild...

796
01:16:28,668 --> 01:16:31,128
and the Corporate Alliance
to sign the treaty.

797
01:16:31,212 --> 01:16:34,006
What about the senator from Naboo?

798
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:36,675
Is she dead yet?

799
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:41,346
I am not signing your treaty
until I have her head on my desk.

800
01:16:41,431 --> 01:16:43,765
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.

801
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:46,935
With these new battle droids
we've built for you...

802
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:50,189
you'll have the finest army in the galaxy.

803
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:03,035
As I explained to you earlier...

804
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:06,371
I am quite convinced
that 10,000 more systems...

805
01:17:06,456 --> 01:17:09,333
will rally to our cause
with your support, gentlemen.

806
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:13,212
What you are proposing
could be construed as treason.

807
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:15,839
The Techno Union army...

808
01:17:19,052 --> 01:17:21,887
is at your disposal, Count.

809
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:26,225
The Banking Clan will sign your treaty.

810
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:28,227
Good. Very good.

811
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:32,981
Our friends from the Trade Federation
have pledged their support...

812
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:35,734
and when their battle droids
are combined with yours...

813
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:38,904
we shall have an army
greater than any in the galaxy.

814
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:42,407
The Jedi will be overwhelmed.

815
01:17:43,493 --> 01:17:47,329
The Republic will agree
to any demands we make.

816
01:18:48,141 --> 01:18:50,142
Mom?

817
01:18:52,437 --> 01:18:54,563
Ani?

818
01:18:55,773 --> 01:18:57,608
Ani?

819
01:18:58,818 --> 01:19:00,485
Is it you?

820
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:04,156
I'm here, Mom. You're safe.

821
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:13,540
You look so handsome.

822
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:19,046
My son.

823
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:21,923
My grown-up son.

824
01:19:23,426 --> 01:19:25,719
I'm so proud of you, Ani.

825
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:27,763
I missed you.

826
01:19:30,475 --> 01:19:32,643
Now I am complete.

827
01:19:38,608 --> 01:19:41,693
I love y...

828
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:45,947
Stay with me, Mom. Everything...

829
01:19:46,032 --> 01:19:48,200
I love...

830
01:19:49,661 --> 01:19:52,162
I love...

831
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:51,263
Anakin!

832
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:53,265
No!

833
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:15,328
What is it?

834
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:19,875
Pain, suffering...

835
01:21:20,418 --> 01:21:22,461
death I feel.

836
01:21:26,966 --> 01:21:30,135
Something terrible has happened.

837
01:21:32,764 --> 01:21:35,807
Young Skywalker is in pain...

838
01:21:35,892 --> 01:21:37,809
terrible pain.

839
01:21:42,565 --> 01:21:46,234
The transmitter is working,
but we're not receiving a return signal.

840
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:49,112
Coruscant's too far.
R4, can you boost the power?

841
01:21:50,615 --> 01:21:52,657
We'll have to try something else.

842
01:21:55,495 --> 01:21:58,580
Maybe we can contact Anakin on Naboo.

843
01:21:58,664 --> 01:22:00,332
It's much closer.

844
01:22:02,126 --> 01:22:04,503
Anakin, do you copy?

845
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:07,589
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin?

846
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:10,008
He's not on Naboo, R4.

847
01:22:11,552 --> 01:22:13,762
I'm going to try and widen the range.

848
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:19,184
I do hope nothing's happened to him.

849
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:28,527
That's Anakin's tracking
signal, all right...

850
01:22:28,611 --> 01:22:31,112
but it's coming from Tatooine.

851
01:22:32,657 --> 01:22:35,283
What in the blazes is he doing there?

852
01:22:35,368 --> 01:22:37,369
I told him to stay on Naboo.

853
01:22:40,832 --> 01:22:42,541
We haven't got much time.

854
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:44,709
Anakin, do you copy?

855
01:22:44,794 --> 01:22:46,878
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.

856
01:22:54,762 --> 01:22:56,721
Retransmit this message...

857
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:01,434
Anakin, do you copy?

858
01:23:01,519 --> 01:23:03,895
My long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.

859
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:06,398
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.

860
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:52,903
I brought you something.

861
01:23:52,987 --> 01:23:55,113
Are you hungry?

862
01:23:56,782 --> 01:23:58,867
The shifter broke.

863
01:24:00,703 --> 01:24:03,538
Life seems so much simpler
when you're fixing things.

864
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:09,461
I'm good at fixing things. Always was.

865
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:13,798
But I couldn't...

866
01:24:17,637 --> 01:24:19,721
Why'd she have to die?

867
01:24:23,142 --> 01:24:25,310
Why couldn't I save her?

868
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:27,479
I know I could have!

869
01:24:30,149 --> 01:24:32,817
Sometimes there are things no one can fix.

870
01:24:34,487 --> 01:24:37,155
- You're not all-powerful, Ani.
- Well, I should be!

871
01:24:39,909 --> 01:24:42,160
Someday I will be.

872
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:44,913
I will be the most powerful Jedi ever.

873
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:48,667
I promise you.

874
01:24:49,335 --> 01:24:51,795
I will even learn to
stop people from dying.

875
01:24:55,383 --> 01:24:59,511
It's all Obi-Wan's fault! He's jealous!

876
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:01,680
He's holding me back!

877
01:25:05,851 --> 01:25:08,103
What's wrong, Ani?

878
01:25:18,656 --> 01:25:20,824
I killed them.

879
01:25:22,368 --> 01:25:24,536
I killed them all.

880
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:28,248
They're dead.

881
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:30,458
Every single one of them.

882
01:25:32,503 --> 01:25:34,546
And not just the men...

883
01:25:36,465 --> 01:25:38,550
but the women...

884
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:40,593
and the children too.

885
01:25:41,512 --> 01:25:43,596
They're like animals...

886
01:25:43,681 --> 01:25:46,057
and I slaughtered them like animals!

887
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:49,686
I hate them!

888
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:09,497
To be angry is to be human.

889
01:26:09,582 --> 01:26:11,499
I'm a Jedi.

890
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:14,502
I know I'm better than this.

891
01:26:28,309 --> 01:26:33,021
I know wherever you are
it's become a better place.

892
01:26:33,105 --> 01:26:38,276
You were the most loving partner
a man could ever have.

893
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:43,281
Good-bye, my darling wife.

894
01:26:47,244 --> 01:26:49,245
And thank you.

895
01:27:16,357 --> 01:27:18,775
I wasn't strong enough to save you, Mom.

896
01:27:21,237 --> 01:27:23,154
I wasn't strong enough.

897
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:31,079
But I promise I won't fail again.

898
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:44,092
I miss you...

899
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:47,387
so much.

900
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:57,021
R2? What are you doing here?

901
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:04,195
It seems that he is carrying
a message from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

902
01:28:04,989 --> 01:28:08,283
Master Ani, does that name
mean anything to you?

903
01:28:10,369 --> 01:28:12,871
Anakin, my long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.

904
01:28:12,955 --> 01:28:15,248
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.

905
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:21,963
I have tracked the bounty hunter,
Jango Fett...

906
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:24,215
to the droid foundries on Geonosis.

907
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:27,969
The Trade Federation is
to take delivery of a droid army here...

908
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:30,096
and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray...

909
01:28:30,181 --> 01:28:33,683
is behind the assassination attempts
on Senator Amidala.

910
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:35,935
The Commerce Guilds
and the Corporate Alliance...

911
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:39,731
have both pledged their armies
to Count Dooku and are forming...

912
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:41,900
Wait.

913
01:28:52,703 --> 01:28:57,373
More happening on Geonosis, I feel,
than has been revealed.

914
01:28:57,458 --> 01:28:59,250
I agree.

915
01:29:00,628 --> 01:29:02,921
We will deal with Count Dooku.

916
01:29:03,005 --> 01:29:06,591
The most important thing for you
is to stay where you are.

917
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:09,427
Protect the senator at all costs.

918
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:12,096
That is your first priority.

919
01:29:13,474 --> 01:29:15,475
Understood, Master.

920
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:17,518
They'll never get there
in time to save him.

921
01:29:17,603 --> 01:29:20,897
They have to come halfway
across the galaxy. Look.

922
01:29:23,025 --> 01:29:25,151
Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

923
01:29:25,236 --> 01:29:27,237
If he's still alive.

924
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:31,783
Are you just gonna sit
here and let him die?

925
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:34,452
- He's your friend, your mentor.
- He's like my father!

926
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:39,290
But you heard Master Windu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here.

927
01:29:39,375 --> 01:29:42,627
He gave you strict orders to protect me...

928
01:29:42,711 --> 01:29:44,963
and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.

929
01:29:46,298 --> 01:29:49,884
If you plan to protect me,
you'll just have to come along.

930
01:29:53,764 --> 01:29:57,100
I'm not worried, R2.
It's just I've never flown before.

931
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:10,321
The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war.
There can be no doubt of that.

932
01:30:10,406 --> 01:30:12,407
Count Dooku must have
made a treaty with them.

933
01:30:12,491 --> 01:30:15,910
The debate is over.

934
01:30:15,995 --> 01:30:18,997
Now we need that clone army.

935
01:30:19,081 --> 01:30:22,041
Unfortunately, the debate is not over.

936
01:30:22,126 --> 01:30:24,585
The senate will never approve
the use of clones...

937
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:26,462
before the separatists attack.

938
01:30:26,547 --> 01:30:28,423
This is a crisis.

939
01:30:28,507 --> 01:30:31,676
The senate must vote the chancellor
emergency powers.

940
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:35,096
He can then approve the
creation of an army.

941
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:37,390
But what senator would have the courage...

942
01:30:37,474 --> 01:30:40,059
to propose such a radical amendment?

943
01:30:40,144 --> 01:30:44,272
If only Senator Amidala were here.

944
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:07,879
Traitor.

945
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:11,132
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.

946
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:13,343
They have gone too far. This is madness.

947
01:31:13,427 --> 01:31:16,054
I thought you were the leader here, Dooku.

948
01:31:16,138 --> 01:31:18,765
This had nothing to do
with me, I assure you.

949
01:31:18,849 --> 01:31:22,310
I will petition immediately
to have you set free.

950
01:31:22,394 --> 01:31:26,064
Well, I hope it doesn't take too long.
I have work to do.

951
01:31:26,148 --> 01:31:29,984
May I ask why a Jedi knight...

952
01:31:30,069 --> 01:31:32,528
is all the way out here on Geonosis?

953
01:31:32,613 --> 01:31:35,490
I've been tracking a bounty hunter
named Jango Fett.

954
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:37,283
Do you know him?

955
01:31:37,368 --> 01:31:40,161
There are no bounty hunters here
that I am aware of.

956
01:31:40,245 --> 01:31:42,246
The Geonosians don't trust them.

957
01:31:42,331 --> 01:31:45,249
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.

958
01:31:46,335 --> 01:31:50,546
It's a great pity our paths
have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.

959
01:31:51,173 --> 01:31:53,674
Qui-Gon always spoke very highly of you.

960
01:31:58,514 --> 01:32:00,598
I wish he were still alive.

961
01:32:02,017 --> 01:32:04,769
I could use his help right now.

962
01:32:05,604 --> 01:32:08,106
Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.

963
01:32:09,858 --> 01:32:12,777
Don't be so sure, my young Jedi.

964
01:32:12,861 --> 01:32:15,446
You forget that he was
once my apprentice...

965
01:32:15,531 --> 01:32:17,615
just as you were once his.

966
01:32:18,534 --> 01:32:20,743
He knew all about the corruption
in the senate...

967
01:32:20,828 --> 01:32:23,913
but he wouldn't have gone along with
it if he had learned the truth as I have.

968
01:32:23,997 --> 01:32:26,791
- The truth?
- The truth.

969
01:32:33,132 --> 01:32:35,883
What if I told you that the Republic
was now under the control...

970
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:38,219
of the dark lord of the Sith?

971
01:32:38,303 --> 01:32:41,639
No, that's not possible.
The Jedi would be aware of it.

972
01:32:41,723 --> 01:32:45,977
The dark side of the Force
has clouded their vision, my friend.

973
01:32:47,104 --> 01:32:49,689
Hundreds of senators
are now under the influence...

974
01:32:49,773 --> 01:32:54,444
of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.

975
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,071
I don't believe you.

976
01:32:57,156 --> 01:32:59,574
The viceroy of the Trade Federation...

977
01:32:59,658 --> 01:33:02,910
was once in league with
this Darth Sidious...

978
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:07,623
but he was betrayed
ten years ago by the dark lord.

979
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:10,835
He came to me for help.
He told me everything.

980
01:33:12,838 --> 01:33:14,922
You must join me, Obi-Wan...

981
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:20,136
and together we will destroy the Sith!

982
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:24,140
I will never join you, Dooku.

983
01:33:33,442 --> 01:33:36,527
It may be difficult to secure your release.

984
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:50,041
It's-a clear desa separatists made a pact
wesa desa Federation du Trade.

985
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:54,462
Senators, "dellow felagates":

986
01:33:54,546 --> 01:33:58,591
In response to this direct threat
to the Republic...

987
01:33:58,675 --> 01:34:02,386
mesa propose that the senate...

988
01:34:02,471 --> 01:34:06,140
give immediately emergency powers...

989
01:34:06,225 --> 01:34:08,893
to the supreme chancellor.

990
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:15,107
Palpatine! Palpatine!

991
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:21,447
Order! We shall have order!

992
01:34:23,075 --> 01:34:26,452
It is with great reluctance...

993
01:34:26,537 --> 01:34:28,663
that I have agreed to this calling.

994
01:34:29,831 --> 01:34:34,001
I love democracy. I love the Republic.

995
01:34:34,836 --> 01:34:37,046
The power you give me...

996
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:41,676
I will lay down when
this crisis has abated.

997
01:34:46,139 --> 01:34:50,977
And as my first act with
this new authority...

998
01:34:51,061 --> 01:34:55,481
I will create a grand
army of the Republic...

999
01:34:55,566 --> 01:34:59,360
to counter the increasing threats
of the separatists.

1000
01:35:00,696 --> 01:35:02,613
It is done, then.

1001
01:35:07,786 --> 01:35:11,581
I will take what Jedi we have left
and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.

1002
01:35:11,665 --> 01:35:15,585
Visit I will the cloners on Kamino...

1003
01:35:16,587 --> 01:35:20,881
and see this army
they have created for the Republic.

1004
01:35:40,944 --> 01:35:43,029
See those columns of steam straight ahead?

1005
01:35:43,113 --> 01:35:45,197
They're exhaust vents of some type.

1006
01:35:45,991 --> 01:35:48,034
That'll do.

1007
01:35:57,336 --> 01:36:00,421
Look, whatever happens
out there, follow my lead.

1008
01:36:00,505 --> 01:36:02,590
I'm not interested in
getting into a war here.

1009
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:04,383
As a member of the senate...

1010
01:36:04,468 --> 01:36:07,845
maybe I can find
a diplomatic solution to this mess.

1011
01:36:07,929 --> 01:36:09,930
Don't worry.

1012
01:36:10,015 --> 01:36:12,475
I've given up trying to argue with you.

1013
01:36:17,189 --> 01:36:20,441
My obtuse little friend,
if they had needed our help...

1014
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:22,443
they would have asked for it.

1015
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:25,696
You obviously have a great deal
to learn about human behavior.

1016
01:36:51,556 --> 01:36:54,767
For a mechanic, you seem to do
an excessive amount of thinking.

1017
01:36:56,812 --> 01:36:59,438
I am programmed to understand humans!

1018
01:37:02,984 --> 01:37:04,902
"What does that mean?"

1019
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:07,738
That means I am in charge here!

1020
01:37:07,823 --> 01:37:09,490
Where are you going now?

1021
01:37:09,574 --> 01:37:13,327
You don't know what's out there.
Have you no sense at all?

1022
01:37:13,412 --> 01:37:15,162
Idiot!

1023
01:37:17,249 --> 01:37:19,083
Please wait.

1024
01:37:19,876 --> 01:37:21,877
Do you know where you're going?

1025
01:37:34,307 --> 01:37:36,100
Wait.

1026
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:53,594
Oh, my goodness!

1027
01:38:53,678 --> 01:38:55,304
Shut me down!

1028
01:38:56,181 --> 01:38:58,349
Machines making machines.

1029
01:38:58,433 --> 01:38:59,975
How perverse!

1030
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:02,311
Calm down, R2!

1031
01:39:02,395 --> 01:39:04,897
I almost fell.

1032
01:39:04,981 --> 01:39:07,024
You'll get your chance...

1033
01:39:08,819 --> 01:39:10,861
I'm scrap.

1034
01:39:11,863 --> 01:39:14,281
It's a nightmare!

1035
01:39:16,034 --> 01:39:18,035
I want to go home!

1036
01:39:19,538 --> 01:39:21,497
What did I do to deserve this?

1037
01:40:01,204 --> 01:40:03,622
I wonder what happened to poor little R2.

1038
01:40:03,707 --> 01:40:06,125
He's always getting himself into trouble.

1039
01:40:07,419 --> 01:40:09,086
Oh, no!

1040
01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:20,139
Uh-oh.

1041
01:40:23,727 --> 01:40:25,769
I'm so confused.

1042
01:42:21,678 --> 01:42:23,637
Not again!

1043
01:42:23,722 --> 01:42:25,764
Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.

1044
01:42:34,774 --> 01:42:36,316
Don't move, Jedi!

1045
01:42:36,401 --> 01:42:37,943
Take him away.

1046
01:42:56,921 --> 01:42:58,797
Don't be afraid.

1047
01:43:00,508 --> 01:43:02,593
I'm not afraid to die.

1048
01:43:07,348 --> 01:43:11,560
I've been dying a little bit each day
since you came back into my life.

1049
01:43:12,771 --> 01:43:15,397
What are you talking about?

1050
01:43:16,691 --> 01:43:18,942
I love you.

1051
01:43:22,614 --> 01:43:24,615
You love me?

1052
01:43:29,079 --> 01:43:32,372
I thought we had decided
not to fall in love...

1053
01:43:34,084 --> 01:43:37,127
that we would be forced to live a lie...

1054
01:43:37,962 --> 01:43:41,006
and that it would destroy our lives.

1055
01:43:41,633 --> 01:43:44,134
I think our lives are about
to be destroyed anyway.

1056
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:51,141
I truly...

1057
01:43:52,102 --> 01:43:54,561
deeply love you...

1058
01:43:55,730 --> 01:43:58,315
and before we die, I want you to know.

1059
01:44:55,456 --> 01:44:58,125
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd got my message.

1060
01:44:58,209 --> 01:45:01,295
I retransmitted it
just as you had requested, Master.

1061
01:45:03,631 --> 01:45:05,549
Then we decided to come and rescue you.

1062
01:45:06,467 --> 01:45:08,051
Good job.

1063
01:45:20,356 --> 01:45:23,442
Settle down. Settle down.

1064
01:45:27,405 --> 01:45:31,200
Let the executions begin.

1065
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:06,902
I've got a bad feeling about this.

1066
01:46:32,387 --> 01:46:34,930
- Just relax. Concentrate.
- What about Padmé?

1067
01:46:35,014 --> 01:46:37,182
She seems to be on top of things.

1068
01:47:40,121 --> 01:47:41,872
She can't do that!

1069
01:47:41,956 --> 01:47:43,915
Shoot her... or something!

1070
01:49:02,703 --> 01:49:04,162
Jump!

1071
01:49:28,229 --> 01:49:31,314
This isn't how it's supposed to be!

1072
01:49:31,399 --> 01:49:33,567
Jango! Finish her off!

1073
01:49:33,651 --> 01:49:36,903
Patience, Viceroy, patience. She will die.

1074
01:50:07,685 --> 01:50:09,227
Master Windu.

1075
01:50:09,312 --> 01:50:11,646
How pleasant of you to join us.

1076
01:50:11,731 --> 01:50:13,815
This party's over.

1077
01:50:27,330 --> 01:50:29,623
Brave...

1078
01:50:29,707 --> 01:50:32,083
but foolish, my old Jedi friend.

1079
01:50:32,168 --> 01:50:34,044
You're impossibly outnumbered.

1080
01:50:34,128 --> 01:50:36,463
I don't think so.

1081
01:50:36,547 --> 01:50:38,048
We'll see.

1082
01:51:16,754 --> 01:51:19,422
My legs aren't moving.
I must need maintenance.

1083
01:51:59,005 --> 01:52:01,590
What's all this noise? A battle!

1084
01:52:01,674 --> 01:52:03,883
There's been some terrible mistake!

1085
01:52:03,968 --> 01:52:06,761
I'm programmed for etiquette,
not destruction!

1086
01:53:34,225 --> 01:53:36,101
Die, Jedi dogs!

1087
01:53:36,185 --> 01:53:38,019
Oh! What did I say?

1088
01:53:47,029 --> 01:53:50,407
Oh, dear.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1089
01:53:55,996 --> 01:53:58,957
Excuse me. I'm trapped. I can't get up.

1090
01:54:12,847 --> 01:54:16,933
- You call this a diplomatic solution?
- No, I call it aggressive negotiations.

1091
01:54:22,022 --> 01:54:24,065
- Uh-oh.
- Roger, roger.

1092
01:54:42,168 --> 01:54:44,461
R2, what are you doing here?

1093
01:54:47,631 --> 01:54:49,007
What are you doing?

1094
01:54:49,091 --> 01:54:51,718
Stop that!
You're going to strain something.

1095
01:54:51,802 --> 01:54:53,636
My neck!

1096
01:54:55,890 --> 01:54:58,975
Now where are you taking me?
This is such a drag!

1097
01:55:03,939 --> 01:55:06,024
I'm quite beside myself.

1098
01:55:14,700 --> 01:55:17,952
R2, please be careful!
You're singeing my circuits!

1099
01:55:19,371 --> 01:55:21,956
Yes, but is my head on straight?

1100
01:55:44,647 --> 01:55:46,314
Master Windu...

1101
01:55:46,398 --> 01:55:48,691
you have fought gallantly...

1102
01:55:49,777 --> 01:55:53,863
worthy of recognition
in the archives of the Jedi order.

1103
01:55:55,783 --> 01:55:57,158
Now...

1104
01:55:58,035 --> 01:56:00,495
it is finished.

1105
01:56:00,579 --> 01:56:02,580
Surrender...

1106
01:56:02,665 --> 01:56:05,416
and your lives will be spared.

1107
01:56:06,126 --> 01:56:09,379
We will not be hostages
to be bartered, Dooku!

1108
01:56:09,463 --> 01:56:10,547
Then...

1109
01:56:11,966 --> 01:56:14,092
I'm sorry, old friend.

1110
01:56:24,728 --> 01:56:26,229
Look!

1111
01:56:37,908 --> 01:56:42,203
Around the survivors a perimeter create.

1112
01:57:38,636 --> 01:57:41,763
I've had the most peculiar dream!

1113
01:57:52,316 --> 01:57:54,317
If Dooku escapes...

1114
01:57:54,401 --> 01:57:58,154
rally more systems to his cause he will.

1115
01:58:02,660 --> 01:58:04,494
Hold on!

1116
01:58:09,041 --> 01:58:11,042
Aim right above the fuel cells!

1117
01:58:17,341 --> 01:58:19,634
Good call, my young Padawan.

1118
01:58:33,649 --> 01:58:36,192
The Jedi have amassed a huge army.

1119
01:58:36,276 --> 01:58:38,444
That doesn't seem possible.

1120
01:58:38,529 --> 01:58:41,155
How could the Jedi
come up with an army so quickly?

1121
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:44,701
We must send all available
droids into battle.

1122
01:58:44,785 --> 01:58:46,744
There are too many.

1123
01:58:47,454 --> 01:58:50,498
Our communications have been jammed.

1124
01:58:58,382 --> 01:59:01,592
Pilot, land in that assembly area!

1125
01:59:01,677 --> 01:59:03,052
Yes, sir.

1126
01:59:11,061 --> 01:59:15,064
Sir. I have five special commando units
awaiting your orders, sir.

1127
01:59:16,066 --> 01:59:19,402
To the forward command center take me.

1128
01:59:42,676 --> 01:59:45,470
Attack those Federation starships, quickly!

1129
01:59:56,398 --> 02:00:00,234
Master Yoda,
all forward positions are advancing.

1130
02:00:00,319 --> 02:00:02,195
Very good.

1131
02:00:02,780 --> 02:00:04,447
Very good.

1132
02:00:32,643 --> 02:00:34,811
This is not looking good at all!

1133
02:00:36,313 --> 02:00:39,315
We must get the starships back into space.

1134
02:00:42,319 --> 02:00:46,280
We have to order a retreat.

1135
02:00:46,365 --> 02:00:48,741
My master will never allow the Republic...

1136
02:00:48,826 --> 02:00:51,202
to get away with this treachery.

1137
02:00:51,286 --> 02:00:54,539
I'm sending my warriors
to hide in the catacombs.

1138
02:00:55,290 --> 02:00:58,668
The Jedi must not find
our designs for the ultimate weapon.

1139
02:01:01,088 --> 02:01:06,467
If they find out what we are planning
to build, we're doomed.

1140
02:01:09,513 --> 02:01:12,140
I will take the designs
with me to Coruscant.

1141
02:01:12,933 --> 02:01:15,768
They will be much safer
there with my master.

1142
02:02:10,282 --> 02:02:15,077
Concentrate all your fire
on the nearest starship.

1143
02:02:15,162 --> 02:02:17,038
Yes, sir.

1144
02:02:17,122 --> 02:02:20,625
Move all quadrants to sector 515.

1145
02:03:00,707 --> 02:03:02,250
Look over there!

1146
02:03:05,671 --> 02:03:08,089
It's Dooku! Shoot him down!

1147
02:03:08,173 --> 02:03:10,091
We're out of rockets, sir.

1148
02:03:10,175 --> 02:03:13,052
- Follow him!
- We're gonna need some help!

1149
02:03:13,136 --> 02:03:17,265
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!

1150
02:03:40,664 --> 02:03:43,291
Put the ship down!

1151
02:03:43,375 --> 02:03:45,293
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way!

1152
02:03:45,377 --> 02:03:47,169
Follow that speeder!

1153
02:03:53,218 --> 02:03:55,594
- Lower the ship!
- I can't take Dooku alone!

1154
02:03:55,679 --> 02:03:59,181
I need you! If we catch him,
we can end this war right now!

1155
02:03:59,266 --> 02:04:02,310
- We have a job to do!
- I don't care! Put the ship down!

1156
02:04:02,394 --> 02:04:04,687
You will be expelled from the Jedi order!

1157
02:04:04,771 --> 02:04:08,024
- I can't leave her!
- Come to your senses!

1158
02:04:08,108 --> 02:04:10,818
What do you think Padmé would do
were she in your position?

1159
02:04:15,365 --> 02:04:17,450
She would do her duty.

1160
02:04:26,376 --> 02:04:28,377
The droid army is in full retreat.

1161
02:04:28,462 --> 02:04:31,714
Well done, Commander. Bring me a ship.

1162
02:04:58,784 --> 02:05:01,827
You're gonna pay for all the Jedi
that you killed today, Dooku.

1163
02:05:01,912 --> 02:05:03,621
We'll take him together.

1164
02:05:03,705 --> 02:05:05,748
- I'm taking him now!
- No, Anakin! No!

1165
02:05:13,757 --> 02:05:17,343
As you see, my Jedi powers
are far beyond yours.

1166
02:05:17,427 --> 02:05:19,428
Now... back down.

1167
02:05:25,227 --> 02:05:27,103
I don't think so.

1168
02:05:39,408 --> 02:05:42,618
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.

1169
02:05:42,702 --> 02:05:45,830
Yoda holds you in such high esteem.

1170
02:05:48,166 --> 02:05:50,626
Surely you can do better.

1171
02:06:01,763 --> 02:06:03,681
Are you all right?

1172
02:06:03,765 --> 02:06:05,474
Uh-huh.

1173
02:06:06,059 --> 02:06:08,352
We'd better get back
to the forward command center.

1174
02:06:08,437 --> 02:06:10,062
No.

1175
02:06:10,147 --> 02:06:13,691
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.

1176
02:06:13,775 --> 02:06:15,734
Get a transport. Hurry!

1177
02:06:15,819 --> 02:06:16,986
Right away.

1178
02:06:42,053 --> 02:06:43,971
Brave of you, boy.

1179
02:06:45,182 --> 02:06:47,433
But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson.

1180
02:06:47,517 --> 02:06:49,185
I am a slow learner.

1181
02:07:51,581 --> 02:07:53,374
Master Yoda.

1182
02:07:53,458 --> 02:07:56,544
Count Dooku.

1183
02:07:56,628 --> 02:08:00,005
You have interfered with our affairs
for the last time.

1184
02:08:31,121 --> 02:08:34,540
Powerful you have become, Dooku.

1185
02:08:34,624 --> 02:08:37,835
The dark side I sense in you.

1186
02:08:37,919 --> 02:08:40,754
I've become more powerful than any Jedi.

1187
02:08:41,798 --> 02:08:43,507
Even you.

1188
02:08:58,648 --> 02:09:01,942
Much to learn you still have.

1189
02:09:02,027 --> 02:09:05,237
It is obvious that this contest
cannot be decided...

1190
02:09:05,322 --> 02:09:07,615
by our knowledge of the Force...

1191
02:09:09,492 --> 02:09:12,286
but by our skills with a lightsaber.

1192
02:09:53,703 --> 02:09:57,247
Fought well you have, my old Padawan.

1193
02:09:57,332 --> 02:09:59,166
This is just the beginning.

1194
02:12:32,111 --> 02:12:34,780
The Force is with us, Master Sidious.

1195
02:12:34,864 --> 02:12:37,866
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus.

1196
02:12:39,577 --> 02:12:42,329
You have done well.

1197
02:12:42,413 --> 02:12:44,540
I have good news for you, my lord.

1198
02:12:45,917 --> 02:12:49,419
- The war has begun.
- Excellent.

1199
02:12:49,504 --> 02:12:52,381
Everything is going as planned.

1200
02:13:02,308 --> 02:13:06,311
Do you believe what Count Dooku said
about Sidious controlling the senate?

1201
02:13:06,813 --> 02:13:09,064
It doesn't feel right.

1202
02:13:09,148 --> 02:13:12,192
Joined the dark side Dooku has.

1203
02:13:13,736 --> 02:13:15,195
Lies, deceit...

1204
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:19,074
creating mistrust are his ways now.

1205
02:13:19,158 --> 02:13:20,617
Nevertheless...

1206
02:13:20,702 --> 02:13:23,745
I feel we should keep
a closer eye on the senate.

1207
02:13:23,830 --> 02:13:25,914
I agree.

1208
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:28,917
Where is your apprentice?

1209
02:13:29,002 --> 02:13:32,921
On his way to Naboo,
escorting Senator Amidala home.

1210
02:13:34,674 --> 02:13:38,343
I have to admit that without the clones,
it would not have been a victory.

1211
02:13:38,428 --> 02:13:40,554
Victory?

1212
02:13:41,264 --> 02:13:43,765
Victory, you say?

1213
02:13:43,850 --> 02:13:47,603
Master Obi-Wan, not victory.

1214
02:13:48,980 --> 02:13:52,357
The shroud of the dark side has fallen.

1215
02:13:53,776 --> 02:13:57,279
Begun the Clone War has.

1216
02:22:25,830 --> 02:22:26,830
English - US


1
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,938
Lock onto him, R2.

2
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:12,484
Master, General Grievous's
ship is directly ahead...

3
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,819
the one crawling with vulture droids.

4
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:17,447
I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.

5
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:27,665
- Oddball, do you copy?
- Copy, Red Leader.

6
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,043
Mark my position.
Form your squad up behind me.

7
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,045
We're on your tail, General Kenobi.

8
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,089
Set S-foils in attack position.

9
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,021
This is where the fun begins.

10
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:52,148
Let them pass between us.

11
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,042
They're all over me.

12
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:14,170
- Get them off my...
- I'm gonna go help them out.

13
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:17,674
No. They are doing their job
so we can do ours.

14
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,565
Missiles. Pull up.

15
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,194
- They overshot us.
- They're coming around.

16
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:48,037
All right, R4. No, no. Nothing too fancy.

17
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,377
Surge all power units, R2.
Stand by reverse thrusters.

18
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,221
We got 'em, R2.

19
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,733
Flying is for droids.

20
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:26,492
- I'm hit. Anakin?
- I see them.

21
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:27,744
Buzz droids.

22
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,378
R4, be careful. You have a...

23
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,425
Oh, dear.

24
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,387
They're shutting down all the controls.

25
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:48,640
Move to the right so I can
get a clear shot at them.

26
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,934
The mission. Get to the command ship.

27
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,478
Get the chancellor.
I'm running out of tricks here.

28
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:00,652
In the name of...

29
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:06,950
- Hold your fire! You're not helping.
- I agree. Bad idea.

30
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:16,125
I can't see a thing. My cockpit's fogging.

31
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,297
They're all over me. Anakin!

32
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:28,012
- Move to the right.
- Hold on. You'll get us both killed.

33
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,475
Get out of here.
There's nothing more you can do.

34
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,769
I'm not leaving without you, Master.

35
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,614
Get him, R2.

36
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,034
Watch out.

37
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:57,000
R2, hit the buzz droid's center eye.

38
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,509
- Yeah, you got him!
- Great, R2.

39
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,722
The general's command ship is dead ahead.

40
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,892
Have you noticed the shields are still up?

41
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,394
Sorry, Master.

42
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,654
I have a bad feeling about this.

43
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,379
There they are. Get them.

44
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,185
R2, locate the chancellor.

45
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,237
The chancellor's signal
is coming from right there...

46
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,407
the observation platform
at the top of that spire.

47
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:13,451
I sense Count Dooku.

48
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,204
- I sense a trap.
- Next move?

49
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,873
Spring the trap.

50
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,795
R2, go back.
I need you to stay with the ship.

51
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,797
Here. Take this and wait for orders.

52
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:43,606
What's the situation, Captain?

53
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,652
Two Jedi have landed in the main
hangar bay. We're tracking them.

54
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:51,072
Just as Count Dooku predicted.

55
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,286
Destroyers.

56
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,339
Drop your weapons. I said drop 'em.

57
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:10,341
- Roger.
- Roger, roger.

58
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:20,810
Those are Jedi fighters all right.

59
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,401
- Did you press the stop button?
- No. Did you?

60
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,820
There's more than one way out of here.

61
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,781
We don't want to get out.
We want to get moving.

62
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:37,743
R2, activate elevator 31174.

63
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,788
- Come in, R2.
- What that?

64
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:42,790
R2, do you copy?

65
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:46,335
R2, activate the elevator number 31174.

66
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:50,173
Get back to work. That nothin'.

67
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,217
Activate the elevator 31174.

68
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:54,802
R2...

69
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,935
Always on the move.

70
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,022
R2, switch on the comlink.
R2, can you hear me?

71
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,733
R2?

72
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,695
R2! R2!

73
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:20,036
Stop. Stop. R2, we need to be going up.

74
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,373
Hands up, Jedi.

75
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,667
R2, do you copy?

76
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:30,755
R2, do you hear me?
R2, we need to be going up, not down.

77
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:36,886
Hey, you!

78
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:43,726
That's better.

79
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:47,396
You stupid little astro droid.

80
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,201
Oh, it's you.

81
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,121
My eyes! My eyes!

82
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:07,583
- What was that all about?
- R2 has been...

83
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,710
- No loose wire jokes.
- Did I say anything?

84
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,754
- He's trying.
- I didn't say anything.

85
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,294
- Chancellor.
- Are you all right?

86
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,878
Count Dooku.

87
00:11:57,593 --> 00:12:01,470
- This time we will do it together.
- I was about to say that.

88
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,649
Get help. You're no match for him.
He's a Sith lord.

89
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,820
Chancellor Palpatine,
Sith lords are our speciality.

90
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,781
Your swords, please.

91
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:24,368
We don't want to make a mess of things
in front of the chancellor.

92
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:26,704
You won't get away this time, Dooku.

93
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,634
I've been looking forward to this.

94
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:42,928
My powers have doubled since
the last time we met, Count.

95
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:46,515
Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.

96
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,578
Get...

97
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:36,899
I sense great fear in you, Skywalker.

98
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,986
You have hate. You have anger.

99
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,698
But you don't use them.

100
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,761
Good, Anakin. Good.

101
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,223
Kill him.

102
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,268
Kill him now.

103
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,817
I shouldn't.

104
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:23,779
Do it.

105
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,753
You did well, Anakin.

106
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:42,047
He was too dangerous to be kept alive.

107
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,259
Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.

108
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,262
I shouldn't have done that.
It's not the Jedi way.

109
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:53,476
It is only natural. He cut off your arm,
and you wanted revenge.

110
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,728
It wasn't the first time, Anakin.

111
00:14:56,688 --> 00:15:00,483
Remember what you told me about
your mother and the Sand People?

112
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,864
Now we must leave before
more security droids arrive.

113
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,246
Anakin, there's no time.

114
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:16,707
We must get off this ship
before it's too late.

115
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,712
- He seems to be all right.
- Leave him, or we'll never make it.

116
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,881
His fate will be the same as ours.

117
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,138
Prepare for attack!

118
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,351
All batteries, fire! Fire!

119
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,321
Elevator's not working.

120
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,702
R2, activate elevator 3224.

121
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:15,683
- Reverse stabilizers.
- Reversing stabilizers.

122
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,079
Magnetize! Magnetize!

123
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,964
Fire the emergency booster engines.

124
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,888
We're leveling out, sir.

125
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,822
Easy. We're in a bit of a situation here.

126
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:14,533
- Did I miss something?
- Hold on.

127
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:16,827
- What is that?
- Oops.

128
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:18,913
R2. R2, shut down the elevator.

129
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:20,247
Too late. Jump!

130
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,223
Let's see if we can find something
in the hangar bay that's still flyable.

131
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,434
R2, get down here.

132
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,811
R2, do you copy?

133
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:51,528
General, we found the Jedi.
They're in hallway 328.

134
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:53,989
Activate ray shields.

135
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,243
Ray shields.

136
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:01,246
Wait a minute. How did this happen?
We're smarter than this.

137
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:02,706
Apparently not.

138
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:07,878
- I say patience.
- Patience?

139
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:11,256
Yes. R2 will be along in a few moments...

140
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:14,093
and then he'll release the ray shields.

141
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,519
See? No problem.

142
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,439
Don't move.

143
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,695
Do you have a plan B?

144
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,704
Ah, yes.

145
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,914
The negotiator.

146
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:48,252
General Kenobi. We've been waiting for you.

147
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,545
Excuse me.

148
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:53,382
- That wasn't much of a rescue.
- You're welcome.

149
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,634
And...

150
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,804
Anakin Skywalker.

151
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:04,643
I was expecting someone with
your reputation to be a little... older.

152
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:11,066
General Grievous.
You're shorter than I expected.

153
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,987
Jedi scum.

154
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,574
We have a job to do, Anakin.
Try not to upset him.

155
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:28,000
Your lightsabers will make
a fine addition to my collection.

156
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,795
Not this time.
And this time, you won't escape.

157
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,921
R2.

158
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,303
Crush them!

159
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,765
Make them suffer!

160
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,479
Come. Now!

161
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,773
Stay at your stations!

162
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,323
Get him! Get him!

163
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,177
Run!

164
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,641
Don't bother with them.

165
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,060
- Keep the ship in orbit.
- Yes, sir.

166
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,989
You lose, General Kenobi.

167
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,890
Get out of here! Run!

168
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,531
Time to abandon ship.

169
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,166
All the escape pods have been launched.

170
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,335
Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?

171
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,172
- You mean, can I land what's left of it?
- Well?

172
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:42,134
Under the circumstances, I'd say the
ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.

173
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,427
Strap yourselves in.

174
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,056
Open all hatches.
Extend all flaps and drag fins.

175
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,950
We lost something.

176
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:09,536
Not to worry.
We are still flying half a ship.

177
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:16,793
Now we're really picking up speed.

178
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,262
Eight plus 60.

179
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:30,682
- We're in the atmosphere.
- Grab that. Keep us level.

180
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,240
Steady.

181
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,410
Easy, R2.

182
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,249
5000.

183
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,292
Fire ships on the left and the right.

184
00:22:57,377 --> 00:23:00,128
- We'll take you in.
- Copy that.

185
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:06,301
- Landing strip, straight ahead.
- We're coming in too hot.

186
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,751
Another happy landing.

187
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:11,033
Coming, Master?

188
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:15,579
No. I'm not brave enough for politics.
I have to report to the council.

189
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:18,123
Besides, someone needs
to be the poster boy.

190
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:22,085
Hold on. This whole
operation was your idea.

191
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,339
Let us not forget, Anakin, that
you rescued me from the buzz droids.

192
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:27,841
And you killed Count Dooku,
and you rescued the chancellor...

193
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,885
carrying me unconscious on your back.

194
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:32,471
All because of your training.

195
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:36,099
Anakin, let's be fair.
Today you were the hero...

196
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:39,603
and you deserve your glorious day
with the politicians.

197
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:43,440
All right. But you owe me one, and not
for saving your skin for the 10th time.

198
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:44,858
Ninth time.

199
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:49,780
That business on Cato Neimoidia doesn't
count. I'll see you at the briefing.

200
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,662
Chancellor Palpatine, are you all right?

201
00:24:57,747 --> 00:25:00,665
Yes. Thanks to your two Jedi knights.

202
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:05,462
They killed Count Dooku, but
General Grievous has escaped once again.

203
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:09,091
General Grievous will run and hide,
as he always does. He's a coward.

204
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:13,512
But with Count Dooku dead,
he is the leader of the droid army.

205
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,514
And I assure you...

206
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:19,351
the senate will vote to continue the war
as long as Grievous is alive.

207
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:23,522
Then the Jedi Council will make
finding Grievous our highest priority.

208
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,900
- Watch it.
- Excuse me.

209
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,986
- Come along, R2.
- The Republic cannot praise you enough.

210
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:32,239
Thank you, Senator Organa.

211
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:35,909
It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.

212
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,537
Now there I agree with you.

213
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:41,373
In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.

214
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:45,710
But the fighting will continue until
General Grievous is spare parts.

215
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,256
I will do everything I can in the senate.

216
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,092
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.

217
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:03,854
Oh, Anakin.

218
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:08,900
I've missed you, Padmé.

219
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:13,321
There were whispers that you'd been killed.

220
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:15,323
I'm all right.

221
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:19,077
It feels like we've been
apart for a lifetime.

222
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:21,997
And it might have been,
if the chancellor hadn't been kidnapped.

223
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,459
I don't think they would have ever brought
us back from the outer rim sieges.

224
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:28,211
- Wait. Not here.
- Yes, here.

225
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:31,798
I'm tired of all this deception.
I don't care if they know we're married.

226
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:34,176
Anakin, don't say things like that.

227
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:46,605
Are you all right? You're trembling.

228
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,857
What's going on?

229
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:53,111
Something wonderful has happened.

230
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:58,366
Ani, I'm pregnant.

231
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:04,039
That's...

232
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:11,838
That's wonderful.

233
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,718
What are we gonna do?

234
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,598
We're not gonna worry about
anything right now. All right?

235
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,184
This is a happy moment.

236
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,480
The happiest moment of my life.

237
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:37,465
Yes, Lord Sidious?

238
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,467
General Grievous...

239
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:44,681
I suggest you move
the separatist leaders to Mustafar.

240
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,851
It will be done, my lord.

241
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:53,023
The end of the war is near, General.

242
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:56,735
But the loss of Count Dooku...

243
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:00,989
His death was a necessary loss.

244
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:05,410
Soon I will have a new apprentice...

245
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:10,790
one far younger and more powerful.

246
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:40,820
Ani, I want to have our baby
back home on Naboo.

247
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:44,282
We can go to the lake country
where no one will know...

248
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:46,284
where we can be safe.

249
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:49,829
I can go early and fix up the baby's room.

250
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:57,837
I know the perfect spot.
Right by the gardens.

251
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:05,720
You are so... beautiful.

252
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,391
It's only because I'm so in love.

253
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,145
No, it's because I'm so in love with you.

254
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,191
So love has blinded you?

255
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:22,696
That's not exactly what I meant.

256
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,324
But it's probably true.

257
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:38,044
Anakin, help me!

258
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,609
What's bothering you?

259
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,030
Nothing.

260
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,326
I remember when I gave this to you.

261
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:55,622
How long is it gonna take for us
to be honest with each other?

262
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,669
- It was a dream.
- Bad?

263
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:06,883
Like the ones I used to have about
my mother, just before she died.

264
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,301
And?

265
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,681
And it was about you.

266
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,560
Tell me.

267
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:21,856
It was only a dream.

268
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:36,746
You die in childbirth.

269
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:39,666
And the baby?

270
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:42,085
I don't know.

271
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:47,799
- It was only a dream.
- I won't let this one become real.

272
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:51,553
This baby will change our lives.

273
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,473
I doubt the queen will continue
to allow me to serve in the senate.

274
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:57,976
If the council discovers
you're the father, you'll be expelled...

275
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,019
I know. I know.

276
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:04,399
Do you think Obi-Wan might
be able to help us?

277
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:08,444
We don't need his help.

278
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,782
Our baby is a blessing.

279
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:30,466
Premonitions?

280
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:32,051
Premonitions.

281
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,388
These visions you have...

282
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:40,101
They're of pain, suffering.

283
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,938
Death.

284
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:48,443
Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?

285
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:51,946
Someone.

286
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:53,948
Close to you?

287
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:56,618
Yes.

288
00:33:57,453 --> 00:34:01,331
Careful you must be when
sensing the future, Anakin.

289
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:05,752
The fear of loss is a
path to the dark side.

290
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,506
I won't let these visions
come true, Master Yoda.

291
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:14,552
Death is a natural part of life.

292
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:19,349
Rejoice for those around you
who transform into the Force.

293
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:22,727
Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not.

294
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,939
Attachment leads to jealousy.

295
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:29,484
The shadow of greed that is.

296
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,819
What must I do, Master Yoda?

297
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:35,573
Train yourself to let go...

298
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:39,118
of everything you fear to lose.

299
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:52,382
You've missed the report
on the outer rim sieges.

300
00:34:53,676 --> 00:34:56,094
I'm sorry. I was held up.

301
00:34:56,178 --> 00:35:00,098
- I have no excuse.
- In short, they are going very well.

302
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:05,395
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

303
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,397
What's wrong, then?

304
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:13,695
The senate is expected to vote more
executive powers to the chancellor today.

305
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:18,157
That can only mean less deliberating
and more action. Is that bad?

306
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:20,702
It'll make it easier for
us to end this war.

307
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:24,747
Be careful of your friend Palpatine.

308
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,292
Be careful of what?

309
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:31,045
- He has requested your presence.
- What for?

310
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,339
He would not say.

311
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:37,010
He didn't inform the council?
That's unusual, isn't it?

312
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:39,345
All of this is unusual.

313
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,806
And it's making me feel uneasy.

314
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:58,781
I hope you trust me, Anakin.

315
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,034
Of course.

316
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:04,078
I need your help, son.

317
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:07,248
What do you mean?

318
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,917
I'm depending on you.

319
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:12,545
For what? I don't understand.

320
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:18,259
To be the eyes, ears
and voice of the Republic.

321
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:24,724
I'm appointing you to be my personal
representative on the Jedi Council.

322
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,184
Me?

323
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,352
A master?

324
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,606
I'm overwhelmed, sir.

325
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:36,611
But the council elects its own members.
They'll never accept this.

326
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:40,239
I think they will. They need you.

327
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,034
More than you know.

328
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:58,216
Allow this appointment lightly
the council does not.

329
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,761
Disturbing is this move
by Chancellor Palpatine.

330
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,514
I understand.

331
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:06,974
You are on this council...

332
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:09,685
but we do not grant you the rank of master.

333
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:11,813
What?

334
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:20,279
How can you do this? This is outrageous.

335
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:21,948
It's unfair.

336
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:27,161
How can you be on the council
and not be a master?

337
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,790
Take a seat, young Skywalker.

338
00:37:33,836 --> 00:37:35,503
Forgive me, Master.

339
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:42,135
We have surveyed
all systems in the Republic...

340
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:45,972
but have found no sign of General Grievous.

341
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:48,850
Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is.

342
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:52,061
The outlying systems you must sweep.

343
00:37:52,146 --> 00:37:54,397
We do not have many ships to spare.

344
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,691
What about the droid
attack on the Wookiees?

345
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:00,486
It is critical we send
an attack group there immediately.

346
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:04,031
He's right. It's a system
we cannot afford to lose.

347
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,451
Go I will.

348
00:38:07,536 --> 00:38:10,580
Good relations with the Wookiees I have.

349
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:12,290
It's settled then.

350
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:17,420
Yoda will take a battalion of clones
to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.

351
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,589
May the Force be with us all.

352
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,468
What kind of nonsense is this?

353
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:26,971
Put me on the council
and not make me a master?

354
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,849
It's never been done in the history
of the Jedi. It's insulting.

355
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:32,810
Calm down, Anakin.
You have been given a great honor.

356
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:35,897
To be on the council at your age...
it's never happened before.

357
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:40,443
The fact of the matter is
you are too close to the chancellor.

358
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:44,322
The council doesn't like it
when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

359
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:47,825
I swear to you,
I didn't ask to be put on the council.

360
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,161
But it's what you wanted.

361
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:53,581
Your friendship with Chancellor
Palpatine seems to have paid off.

362
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,583
That has nothing to do with this.

363
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,628
The only reason the council
has approved your appointment...

364
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:01,088
is because the chancellor trusts you.

365
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,090
And?

366
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:06,969
Anakin, I am on your side. I didn't
want to put you in this situation.

367
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:08,262
What situation?

368
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:16,687
The council wants you to report on
all the chancellor's dealings.

369
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:19,148
They want to know what he's up to.

370
00:39:23,654 --> 00:39:25,696
They want me to spy on the chancellor?

371
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:29,283
- But that's treason.
- We are at war, Anakin.

372
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,247
Why didn't the council give me
this assignment when we were in session?

373
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:36,791
This assignment is not to be on record.

374
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,836
The chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.

375
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:43,965
He befriended me. He's watched out
for me ever since I arrived here.

376
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:46,175
That is why you must help us.

377
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,762
Anakin, our allegiance
is to the senate, not to its leader...

378
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:53,557
who has managed to stay in office
long after his term has expired.

379
00:39:53,642 --> 00:39:55,643
The senate demanded that he stay longer.

380
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,938
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place.

381
00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:03,234
You're asking me to do something
against the Jedi code.

382
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:07,238
Against the Republic.
Against a mentor and a friend.

383
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:11,325
That's what's out of place here.
Why are you asking this of me?

384
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,538
The council is asking you.

385
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:26,465
Anakin did not take to his
new assignment with much enthusiasm.

386
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,553
It's very dangerous, putting them together.

387
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:32,972
I don't think the boy can handle it.

388
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,016
I don't trust him.

389
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:38,936
With all due respect, Master,
is he not the chosen one?

390
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:43,357
Is he not to destroy the Sith
and bring balance to the Force?

391
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:46,319
So the prophecy says.

392
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:51,324
A prophecy that misread could have been.

393
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:55,036
He will not let me down.

394
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,079
He never has.

395
00:40:57,164 --> 00:41:00,207
I hope right you are.

396
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:28,110
Sometimes I wonder what's
happening to the Jedi order.

397
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:32,073
I think this war is destroying
the principles of the Republic.

398
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:37,119
Have you ever considered
that we may be on the wrong side?

399
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:39,121
What do you mean?

400
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:44,418
What if the democracy we thought
we were serving no longer exists...

401
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:48,130
and the Republic has become the very
evil we've been fighting to destroy?

402
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:52,468
I don't believe that.
And you're sounding like a separatist.

403
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:57,390
This war represents a failure to listen.

404
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:59,517
Now you're closer
to the chancellor than anyone.

405
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:02,895
Please, ask him to stop the fighting
and let diplomacy resume.

406
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,564
Don't ask me to do that.

407
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:10,778
Make a motion in the senate,
where that kind of a request belongs.

408
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,697
- What is it?
- Nothing.

409
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:18,869
Don't do this. Don't shut me out.
Let me help you.

410
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:23,124
Hold me.

411
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,501
Like you did by the lake on Naboo.

412
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:29,338
So long ago, when there was
nothing but our love.

413
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:33,968
No politics, no plotting, no war.

414
00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:15,885
- You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
- Yes, Anakin.

415
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:17,970
Come closer. I have good news.

416
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,557
Our clone intelligence units...

417
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:24,727
have discovered
the location of General Grievous.

418
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:27,438
He's hiding in the Utapau system.

419
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:28,731
At last.

420
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:33,319
We'll be able to capture
that monster and end this war.

421
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:36,780
I would worry about
the collective wisdom of the council...

422
00:43:36,865 --> 00:43:39,283
if it didn't select you
for this assignment.

423
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,745
You're the best choice, by far.

424
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:47,249
Sit down.

425
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:48,584
Leave us.

426
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:07,603
You know I'm not able
to rely on the Jedi Council.

427
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:12,733
If they haven't included you
in their plot, they soon will.

428
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:15,778
I'm not sure I understand.

429
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:19,573
You must sense what I have come to suspect.

430
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:23,077
The Jedi Council want
control of the Republic.

431
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,372
They're planning to betray me.

432
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,458
- I don't think that...
- Anakin.

433
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:32,586
Search your feelings.

434
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:37,341
You know, don't you?

435
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43,639
I know they don't trust you.

436
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:47,059
Or the senate. Or the Republic.

437
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:49,770
Or democracy, for that matter.

438
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:54,900
I have to admit,
my trust in them has been shaken.

439
00:44:54,985 --> 00:44:56,485
Why?

440
00:44:58,655 --> 00:45:02,950
They asked you to do something that
made you feel dishonest, didn't they?

441
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:08,831
They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?

442
00:45:13,295 --> 00:45:14,962
I don't...

443
00:45:15,964 --> 00:45:17,881
I don't know what to say.

444
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:21,468
Remember back to your early teachings.

445
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:25,973
All who gain power are afraid to lose it.

446
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:30,728
- Even the Jedi.
- The Jedi use their power for good.

447
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:32,980
Good is a point of view, Anakin.

448
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:38,277
The Sith and the Jedi
are similar in almost every way...

449
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,073
including their quest for greater power.

450
00:45:44,576 --> 00:45:47,620
The Sith rely on their passion
for their strength.

451
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:50,497
They think inwards...
only about themselves.

452
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,959
And the Jedi don't?

453
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:58,631
The Jedi are selfless.
They only care about others.

454
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:13,771
Did you ever hear the tragedy
of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

455
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:22,946
I thought not. It's not a story
the Jedi would tell you.

456
00:46:24,366 --> 00:46:26,367
It's a Sith legend.

457
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:31,497
Darth Plagueis was a
dark lord of the Sith...

458
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:34,500
so powerful and so wise...

459
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:39,463
he could use the Force to
influence the midi-chlorians...

460
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,758
to create... life.

461
00:46:44,386 --> 00:46:47,471
He had such a knowledge of the dark side...

462
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:52,059
he could even keep the
ones he cared about...

463
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:54,645
from dying.

464
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:02,736
He could actually...
save people from death?

465
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:08,117
The dark side of the Force is
a pathway to many abilities...

466
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:12,454
some consider to be unnatural.

467
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,416
What happened to him?

468
00:47:16,418 --> 00:47:18,585
He became so powerful...

469
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:21,964
the only thing he was afraid of was...

470
00:47:23,133 --> 00:47:25,050
losing his power.

471
00:47:25,135 --> 00:47:27,302
Which eventually, of course, he did.

472
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:33,684
Unfortunately, he taught
his apprentice everything he knew.

473
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:37,104
Then his apprentice
killed him in his sleep.

474
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:42,067
It's ironic.

475
00:47:42,152 --> 00:47:44,319
He could save others from death...

476
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:47,531
but not himself.

477
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:54,246
Is it possible to learn this power?

478
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,210
Not from a Jedi.

479
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,979
All Red units, over here!

480
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:33,160
Palpatine thinks General Grievous
is on Utapau?

481
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:35,871
A partial message was intercepted...

482
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:38,457
in a diplomatic packet
from the chairman of Utapau.

483
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:43,128
Act on this we must.

484
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:47,966
The capture of General Grievous
will end this war.

485
00:48:49,052 --> 00:48:51,887
Quickly and decisively we should proceed.

486
00:48:52,764 --> 00:48:57,017
The chancellor has requested...
that I lead the campaign.

487
00:48:57,769 --> 00:49:00,437
The council will make up
its own mind who is to go...

488
00:49:00,522 --> 00:49:02,523
not the chancellor.

489
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:07,569
A master is needed, with more experience.

490
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:11,073
I concur. Master Kenobi should go.

491
00:49:12,242 --> 00:49:13,700
I agree.

492
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:14,952
Aye.

493
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:16,620
Aye.

494
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,664
Very well. Council adjourned.

495
00:49:26,548 --> 00:49:29,258
The droids have started up
their main power generators.

496
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:34,847
- Then now the time is, Commander.
- Yes, sir.

497
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:48,986
Charge!

498
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:06,044
Head for cover!

499
00:50:21,436 --> 00:50:24,354
- You're gonna need me on this one.
- I agree.

500
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:27,316
However, it may turn out
just to be a wild bantha chase.

501
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,567
Master.

502
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:35,824
I've disappointed you. I haven't been
very appreciative of your training.

503
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:39,703
I've been arrogant, and I apologize.

504
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:42,789
I've just been so frustrated
with the council.

505
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:49,838
You are strong and wise, Anakin,
and I am very proud of you.

506
00:50:49,923 --> 00:50:52,549
I have trained you since
you were a small boy.

507
00:50:52,634 --> 00:50:54,760
I have taught you everything I know.

508
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:58,639
And you have become a far greater
Jedi than I could ever hope to be.

509
00:50:59,474 --> 00:51:01,433
But be patient, Anakin.

510
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:05,479
It will not be long before
the council makes you a Jedi master.

511
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:16,114
Obi-Wan. May the Force be with you.

512
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:19,117
Good-bye, old friend.
May the Force be with you.

513
00:51:41,683 --> 00:51:46,269
Fortunately, most of the cities are
concentrated on this small continent here.

514
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:48,021
On the far side.

515
00:51:48,106 --> 00:51:50,440
I'll keep them distracted
until you get there.

516
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:53,986
- Just don't take too long.
- Come on. When have I ever let you down?

517
00:51:55,363 --> 00:52:00,534
Very well. The burden is on me not to
destroy all the droids until you arrive.

518
00:52:25,935 --> 00:52:27,728
Save your energy.

519
00:52:28,396 --> 00:52:30,188
I can't.

520
00:52:30,273 --> 00:52:32,065
Don't give up, Padmé.

521
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,414
Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?

522
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:50,167
He came by this morning.

523
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:53,462
What did he want?

524
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:55,505
He's worried about you.

525
00:52:57,967 --> 00:53:00,260
He says you've been under a lot of stress.

526
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:04,806
I feel lost.

527
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:09,102
Lost? What do you mean?

528
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,398
Obi-Wan and the council don't trust me.

529
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:16,902
They trust you with their lives.

530
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:20,113
Something's happening.

531
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,450
I'm not the Jedi I should be.

532
00:53:25,787 --> 00:53:27,746
I want more.

533
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,874
And I know I shouldn't.

534
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,961
You expect too much of yourself.

535
00:53:38,925 --> 00:53:42,135
- I found a way to save you.
- Save me?

536
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:44,179
From my nightmares.

537
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:46,223
Is that what's bothering you?

538
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:49,184
I won't lose you, Padmé.

539
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,104
I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani.

540
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:54,648
- I promise you.
- No, I promise you.

541
00:54:38,568 --> 00:54:40,986
Greetings, young Jedi.

542
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:44,531
What brings you to our remote sanctuary?

543
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:46,575
Unfortunately, the war.

544
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:51,246
There's no war here...
unless you brought it with you.

545
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,541
With your kind permission,
I should like some fuel...

546
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:59,588
and to use your city as a base as I search
nearby systems for General Grievous.

547
00:55:08,556 --> 00:55:11,850
He is here. We are being held hostage.

548
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:14,853
- They are watching us.
- I understand.

549
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:19,774
Tenth level, thousands of battle droids.

550
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:22,319
Tell your people to take shelter.

551
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:25,405
If you have warriors, now is the time.

552
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:40,545
Take the fighter back to the ship.
Tell Cody I've made contact.

553
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:46,593
- Is he bringing additional warriors?
- He didn't say.

554
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:34,140
It won't be long before the armies
of the Republic track us here.

555
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:41,982
I am sending you to the Mustafar system
in the outer rim.

556
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:51,783
It is a volcanic planet.

557
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:55,203
- You will be safe there.
- Safe?

558
00:56:55,997 --> 00:56:59,291
Chancellor Palpatine managed
to escape your grip, General.

559
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:03,837
Without Count Dooku, I have doubts
about your ability to keep us safe.

560
00:57:04,714 --> 00:57:09,884
Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not
found yourself in my grip.

561
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:16,016
Your ship is waiting.

562
00:57:33,868 --> 00:57:35,160
Hello there.

563
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:39,539
General Kenobi.

564
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:45,045
You are a bold one.

565
00:57:47,048 --> 00:57:48,548
Kill him.

566
00:58:04,357 --> 00:58:05,815
Back away.

567
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:10,528
I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.

568
00:58:10,613 --> 00:58:12,113
Your move.

569
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:14,657
You fool.

570
00:58:14,742 --> 00:58:20,580
I've been trained in your
Jedi arts by Count Dooku.

571
00:58:27,088 --> 00:58:29,589
Attack, Kenobi.

572
00:59:27,273 --> 00:59:29,232
Go, go, go! Move it! Move it!

573
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:31,234
Everybody out.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

574
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:32,819
Cover yourself. Come on.

575
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:40,160
Move it! Move it!

576
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:44,831
Come on, move! Come on, everybody!

577
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:48,251
Army or not...

578
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:53,465
you must realize you are doomed.

579
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:55,550
I don't think so.

580
01:00:53,943 --> 01:00:55,735
Cover that corner.

581
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:03,826
Master Windu, may I interrupt?

582
01:01:03,911 --> 01:01:06,704
General Kenobi has made contact
with General Grievous...

583
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:09,082
and we have begun our attack.

584
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:10,917
Thank you, Commander.

585
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:15,129
Anakin, deliver this
report to the chancellor.

586
01:01:15,214 --> 01:01:17,507
His reaction will give us
a clue to his intentions.

587
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:19,092
Yes, Master.

588
01:01:26,517 --> 01:01:29,018
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.

589
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:32,397
The dark side of the Force
surrounds the chancellor.

590
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:35,316
If he does not give up
his emergency powers...

591
01:01:35,401 --> 01:01:37,318
after the destruction of Grievous...

592
01:01:37,403 --> 01:01:39,654
then he should be removed from office.

593
01:01:41,115 --> 01:01:43,658
The Jedi Council would have to
take control of the senate...

594
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:45,660
in order to secure a peaceful transition.

595
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:50,248
To a dark place this line
of thought will carry us.

596
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:55,211
Great care we must take.

597
01:02:02,011 --> 01:02:03,511
Chancellor.

598
01:02:04,263 --> 01:02:06,806
We've just received a report
from Master Kenobi.

599
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,559
He has engaged General Grievous.

600
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:13,021
We can only hope that Master Kenobi
is up to the challenge.

601
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:16,858
I should be there with him.

602
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:19,319
It's upsetting to me
to see that the council...

603
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:21,487
doesn't seem to fully
appreciate your talents.

604
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:26,909
Don't you wonder why
they won't make you a Jedi master?

605
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:30,580
I wish I knew.

606
01:02:31,874 --> 01:02:34,417
More and more I get the feeling that...

607
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:36,753
I'm being excluded from the council.

608
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:47,680
I know there are things about the Force
that they're not telling me.

609
01:02:49,892 --> 01:02:52,352
They don't trust you, Anakin.

610
01:02:53,062 --> 01:02:55,104
They see your future.

611
01:02:55,189 --> 01:02:59,108
They know your power
will be too strong to control.

612
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:05,323
You must break through the fog of lies
the Jedi have created around you.

613
01:03:07,326 --> 01:03:11,496
Let me help you to know
the subtleties of the Force.

614
01:03:12,206 --> 01:03:14,374
How do you know the ways of the Force?

615
01:03:15,376 --> 01:03:18,461
My mentor taught me
everything about the Force.

616
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:22,215
Even the nature of the dark side.

617
01:03:24,176 --> 01:03:26,552
You know the dark side?

618
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:32,475
If one is to understand
the great mystery...

619
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,977
one must study all its aspects...

620
01:03:35,062 --> 01:03:38,231
not just the dogmatic
narrow view of the Jedi.

621
01:03:38,941 --> 01:03:42,110
If you wish to become
a complete and wise leader...

622
01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:45,905
you must embrace a larger
view of the Force.

623
01:03:46,615 --> 01:03:48,658
Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.

624
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:54,872
Only through me can you achieve
a power greater than any Jedi.

625
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:58,251
Learn to know the dark side of the Force...

626
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:02,004
and you will be able to save your wife...

627
01:04:02,089 --> 01:04:04,173
from certain death.

628
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:07,176
What did you say?

629
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:10,930
Use my knowledge. I beg you.

630
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:14,809
You're the Sith lord.

631
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:18,771
I know what's been troubling you.
Listen to me.

632
01:04:19,732 --> 01:04:23,443
Don't continue to be a pawn
of the Jedi Council.

633
01:04:25,571 --> 01:04:29,031
Ever since I've known you,
you've been searching for a life...

634
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:31,701
greater than that of an ordinary Jedi.

635
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:34,203
A life of significance...

636
01:04:34,288 --> 01:04:35,788
of conscience.

637
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:45,089
- Are you going to kill me?
- I would certainly like to.

638
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:48,551
I know you would.

639
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:52,472
I can feel your anger.

640
01:04:52,556 --> 01:04:55,266
It gives you focus...

641
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,727
makes you stronger.

642
01:05:03,984 --> 01:05:06,360
I'm going to turn you over
to the Jedi Council.

643
01:05:06,445 --> 01:05:08,112
Of course. You should.

644
01:05:08,197 --> 01:05:11,240
But you're not sure
of their intentions, are you?

645
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:13,868
I will quickly discover
the truth of all this.

646
01:05:14,995 --> 01:05:17,413
You have great wisdom, Anakin.

647
01:05:17,498 --> 01:05:21,167
Know the power of the dark side.

648
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:24,045
Power to save Padmé.

649
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:33,758
So uncivilized.

650
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:43,267
Master Windu, I must talk to you.

651
01:07:43,352 --> 01:07:47,188
Skywalker, we just received word that
Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous.

652
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:49,190
We're on our way to make sure...

653
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:51,567
the chancellor returns
emergency power back to the senate.

654
01:07:51,652 --> 01:07:55,321
He won't give up his power.
I've just learned a terrible truth.

655
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:57,573
I think Chancellor
Palpatine is a Sith lord.

656
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:00,576
A Sith lord?

657
01:08:00,661 --> 01:08:03,537
Yes. The one we've been looking for.

658
01:08:03,622 --> 01:08:06,666
- How do you know this?
- He knows the ways of the Force.

659
01:08:07,668 --> 01:08:09,835
He's been trained to use the dark side.

660
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,755
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

661
01:08:14,174 --> 01:08:16,425
Then our worst fears have been realized.

662
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:20,012
We must move quickly
if the Jedi order is to survive.

663
01:08:20,097 --> 01:08:22,556
Master, the chancellor is very powerful.

664
01:08:22,641 --> 01:08:24,934
You'll need my help
if you're going to arrest him.

665
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:27,979
For you own good, stay out of this affair.

666
01:08:28,063 --> 01:08:30,856
I sense a great deal of confusion
in you, young Skywalker.

667
01:08:30,941 --> 01:08:33,109
There is much fear that
clouds your judgment.

668
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:35,194
- I must go, Master.
- No.

669
01:08:37,364 --> 01:08:41,367
If what you've told me is true,
you will have gained my trust.

670
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:44,036
But for now, remain here.

671
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:48,040
Wait in the council
chambers until we return.

672
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:51,585
Yes, Master.

673
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:23,951
You do know, don't you...

674
01:09:24,036 --> 01:09:26,412
if the Jedi destroy me...

675
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:30,499
any chance of saving her will be lost.

676
01:10:59,381 --> 01:11:03,843
Master Windu. I take it General Grievous
has been destroyed then.

677
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:07,221
I must say you're here
sooner than expected.

678
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:10,933
In the name of
the Galactic Senate of the Republic...

679
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:12,977
you're under arrest, Chancellor.

680
01:11:13,061 --> 01:11:15,688
Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?

681
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,731
The senate will decide your fate.

682
01:11:17,816 --> 01:11:21,694
- I am the senate.
- Not yet.

683
01:11:26,992 --> 01:11:29,368
It's treason then.

684
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:11,887
You are under arrest, my lord.

685
01:13:12,973 --> 01:13:17,309
Anakin, I told you it would
come to this. I was right.

686
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:19,561
The Jedi are taking over.

687
01:13:19,646 --> 01:13:22,147
The oppression of the
Sith will never return.

688
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:24,483
You have lost.

689
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:30,281
You will die!

690
01:13:32,993 --> 01:13:34,910
He's a traitor!

691
01:13:34,995 --> 01:13:37,204
He is the traitor!

692
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:44,545
I have the power to save the one you love.

693
01:13:45,505 --> 01:13:47,464
You must choose.

694
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:51,135
Don't listen to him, Anakin!

695
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:54,847
Don't let him kill me.

696
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:00,686
I can't hold it any longer.

697
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:04,106
I can't. I'm weak.

698
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:06,191
I'm too weak.

699
01:14:06,276 --> 01:14:07,735
Anakin!

700
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:10,321
Help me. Help me!

701
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:16,994
I can't hold on any longer.

702
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:20,706
I am going to end this once and for all.

703
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,291
You can't.

704
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:24,376
He must stand trial.

705
01:14:25,378 --> 01:14:27,838
He has control of the
senate and the courts.

706
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:30,174
He's too dangerous to be left alive.

707
01:14:30,258 --> 01:14:32,551
I'm too weak.

708
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:36,263
- Don't kill me. Please.
- It's not the Jedi way.

709
01:14:36,348 --> 01:14:37,890
He must live.

710
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:43,562
- Please don't.
- I need him.

711
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:45,689
Please don't!

712
01:14:53,073 --> 01:14:54,740
Power!

713
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:05,959
Unlimited power!

714
01:15:17,055 --> 01:15:19,098
What have I done?

715
01:15:27,399 --> 01:15:31,360
You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin.

716
01:15:32,529 --> 01:15:35,280
Become my apprentice.

717
01:15:35,365 --> 01:15:40,828
Learn to use the dark side of the Force.

718
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:46,458
I will do whatever you ask.

719
01:15:48,628 --> 01:15:51,088
Good.

720
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:55,384
Just help me save Padmé's life.

721
01:15:57,303 --> 01:15:59,721
I can't live without her.

722
01:16:02,851 --> 01:16:08,272
To cheat death is a power
only one has achieved...

723
01:16:08,356 --> 01:16:11,358
but if we work together...

724
01:16:11,443 --> 01:16:15,487
I know we can discover the secret.

725
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:18,949
I pledge myself...

726
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:22,536
to your teachings.

727
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:25,205
Good.

728
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:28,500
Good.

729
01:16:36,718 --> 01:16:41,180
The Force is strong with you.

730
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:46,852
A powerful Sith you will become.

731
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:51,231
Henceforth you shall be known as...

732
01:16:51,316 --> 01:16:55,235
Darth... Vader.

733
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:03,202
Thank you, my master.

734
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:06,872
Rise.

735
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:25,474
Because the council did not trust you,
my young apprentice...

736
01:17:27,018 --> 01:17:31,813
I believe you are the only Jedi
with no knowledge of this plot.

737
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:35,859
When the Jedi learn
what has transpired here...

738
01:17:35,944 --> 01:17:39,905
they will kill us,
along with all the senators.

739
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,157
I agree.

740
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:46,745
The council's next move
will be against the senate.

741
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:49,540
Every single Jedi...

742
01:17:49,624 --> 01:17:52,918
including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi...

743
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:56,588
is now an enemy of the Republic.

744
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:59,591
I understand, Master.

745
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:02,302
We must move quickly.

746
01:18:02,387 --> 01:18:04,346
The Jedi are relentless.

747
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:10,269
If they are not all destroyed,
it will be civil war without end.

748
01:18:11,938 --> 01:18:15,774
First I want you to go to the Jedi temple.

749
01:18:16,818 --> 01:18:19,903
We will catch them off-balance.

750
01:18:19,988 --> 01:18:23,991
Do what must be done, Lord Vader.

751
01:18:24,075 --> 01:18:27,494
Do not hesitate. Show no mercy.

752
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:32,958
Only then will you be strong enough
with the dark side...

753
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:35,085
to save Padmé.

754
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:40,048
What about the other Jedi
spread across the galaxy?

755
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:43,260
Their betrayal will be dealt with.

756
01:18:45,138 --> 01:18:48,432
After you have killed
all the Jedi in the temple...

757
01:18:48,516 --> 01:18:51,226
go to the Mustafar system.

758
01:18:51,311 --> 01:18:54,605
Wipe out Viceroy Gunray...

759
01:18:54,689 --> 01:18:58,150
and the other separatist leaders.

760
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:04,156
Once more the Sith will rule the galaxy!

761
01:19:05,366 --> 01:19:07,117
And...

762
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:12,331
we shall have... peace.

763
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,417
Sergeant, over here!

764
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:00,379
Hurry! All of them!

765
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:05,050
All Red units, let's move it!

766
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:07,052
Come on. Let's go!

767
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,943
Commander, contact your troops.

768
01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:24,986
Tell them to move to the higher levels.

769
01:20:25,071 --> 01:20:26,988
Very good, sir.

770
01:20:27,073 --> 01:20:29,241
By the way, I think you'll be needing this.

771
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:33,620
Thank you, Cody. Let's get a move on.
We've got a battle to win.

772
01:20:33,705 --> 01:20:34,913
Yes, sir.

773
01:20:41,671 --> 01:20:43,171
Commander Cody...

774
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:47,175
the time has come.

775
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:51,555
Execute order 66.

776
01:20:52,265 --> 01:20:54,224
Yes, my lord.

777
01:20:58,062 --> 01:20:59,438
Blast him!

778
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:27,799
Come on!

779
01:22:18,184 --> 01:22:21,520
Execute order 66.

780
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,147
It will be done, my lord.

781
01:23:06,941 --> 01:23:08,942
It will be done, my lord.

782
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:48,189
Master Skywalker, there
are too many of them.

783
01:23:48,274 --> 01:23:50,275
What are we going to do?

784
01:24:00,745 --> 01:24:04,915
The chancellor's office indicated Master
Anakin returned to the Jedi temple.

785
01:24:04,999 --> 01:24:08,126
Don't worry. I'm sure he'll be all right.

786
01:24:37,323 --> 01:24:40,408
- What's going on here?
- There's been a rebellion, sir.

787
01:24:40,493 --> 01:24:43,119
Don't worry.
The situation is under control.

788
01:24:43,871 --> 01:24:46,456
I'm sorry, sir. It's time for you to leave.

789
01:24:48,167 --> 01:24:50,168
And so it is.

790
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:55,757
Get him!

791
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:15,193
Don't worry about him. Let him go.

792
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:45,015
All these Wookiees are dead.
Move to the east.

793
01:25:45,099 --> 01:25:46,599
Yes, sir.

794
01:25:54,692 --> 01:25:56,609
Good-bye, Tarfful.

795
01:25:56,694 --> 01:25:58,695
Good-bye, Chewbacca.

796
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,408
Miss you I will.

797
01:26:40,404 --> 01:26:42,781
Hopefully we'll be able to
intercept a few Jedi...

798
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:45,200
before they walk into this catastrophe.

799
01:26:50,915 --> 01:26:52,874
Did you find Kenobi?

800
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:54,918
Sir, no one could have survived that fall.

801
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,296
Start loading your men on the ships.

802
01:26:58,380 --> 01:26:59,881
Move it.

803
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:35,208
Emergency code 913.

804
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:37,210
I have no contact on any frequency.

805
01:27:39,922 --> 01:27:41,381
Master Kenobi.

806
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:43,466
- Repeat.
- Master Kenobi.

807
01:27:43,551 --> 01:27:47,512
Senator Organa. My clone troops
turned on me. I need help.

808
01:27:48,472 --> 01:27:50,390
We have just rescued Master Yoda.

809
01:27:50,474 --> 01:27:52,600
It appears this ambush
has happened everywhere.

810
01:27:52,685 --> 01:27:54,853
We're sending you our coordinates.

811
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:04,487
Hush! Not so loud.

812
01:28:04,572 --> 01:28:07,615
Are you all right? I heard there was
an attack on the Jedi temple.

813
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:10,118
- You could see the smoke from here.
- I'm fine.

814
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:12,120
I came to see if you and the baby are safe.

815
01:28:12,204 --> 01:28:13,872
What's happening?

816
01:28:14,707 --> 01:28:16,833
The Jedi have tried to
overthrow the Republic.

817
01:28:17,543 --> 01:28:19,460
I can't believe that.

818
01:28:19,545 --> 01:28:23,131
I saw Master Windu attempt to
assassinate the chancellor myself.

819
01:28:25,885 --> 01:28:27,719
What are you gonna do?

820
01:28:36,395 --> 01:28:38,605
I will not betray the Republic.

821
01:28:40,566 --> 01:28:42,525
My loyalties lie with the chancellor...

822
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:46,404
and with the senate and with you.

823
01:28:47,156 --> 01:28:50,408
- What about Obi-Wan?
- I don't know.

824
01:28:51,118 --> 01:28:53,244
Many Jedi have been killed.

825
01:28:53,329 --> 01:28:56,206
We can only hope that
he's remained loyal to the chancellor.

826
01:28:57,249 --> 01:28:59,626
Anakin, I'm afraid.

827
01:29:02,588 --> 01:29:04,672
Have faith, my love.

828
01:29:04,757 --> 01:29:07,091
Everything will soon be set right.

829
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:10,970
The chancellor has given me
a very important mission.

830
01:29:11,055 --> 01:29:13,932
The separatists have gathered
on the Mustafar system.

831
01:29:14,642 --> 01:29:18,519
I'm going there to end this war.
Wait for me until I return.

832
01:29:18,604 --> 01:29:21,022
Things will be different. I promise.

833
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:28,821
Please, wait for me.

834
01:29:32,868 --> 01:29:35,620
Well, he is under a lot of stress, R2.

835
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:39,791
Take care, my little friend.

836
01:29:44,046 --> 01:29:47,757
Oh, my lady, is there anything I might do?

837
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:50,426
No, thank you, 3PO.

838
01:29:52,763 --> 01:29:55,223
I feel so helpless.

839
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:21,416
How many other Jedi have managed to survive?

840
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:24,085
Heard from no one have we.

841
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:28,047
I saw thousands of troops
attack the Jedi temple.

842
01:30:28,132 --> 01:30:30,049
That's why I went looking for Yoda.

843
01:30:30,134 --> 01:30:32,593
Have we had any contact from the temple?

844
01:30:32,678 --> 01:30:35,680
Received a coded retreat message we have.

845
01:30:36,515 --> 01:30:39,809
It requests all Jedi to
return to the temple.

846
01:30:39,893 --> 01:30:43,354
- It says the war is over.
- Then we must go back.

847
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:46,983
If there are any stragglers, they will
fall into the trap and be killed.

848
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:51,904
Suggest dismantling the
coded signal, do you?

849
01:30:51,989 --> 01:30:54,741
Yes, Master. There is too much at stake.

850
01:30:55,826 --> 01:30:57,410
I agree.

851
01:30:57,494 --> 01:31:01,122
And a little more knowledge
might light our way.

852
01:31:22,061 --> 01:31:25,521
The plan has gone
as you had promised, my lord.

853
01:31:25,606 --> 01:31:28,399
You have done well, Viceroy.

854
01:31:28,484 --> 01:31:34,322
When my new apprentice
Darth Vader arrives...

855
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:37,950
he will take care of you.

856
01:31:50,297 --> 01:31:52,715
We're receiving a message from
the chancellor's office, sir.

857
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,759
- Send it through.
- Yes, sir.

858
01:31:56,470 --> 01:32:01,182
Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor
requests your presence...

859
01:32:01,266 --> 01:32:03,267
at a special session of Congress.

860
01:32:03,352 --> 01:32:06,938
- I will be there.
- He'll be expecting you.

861
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:13,194
- Could be a trap.
- I don't think so.

862
01:32:13,278 --> 01:32:16,406
The chancellor will not be able to
control the thousands of star systems...

863
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:18,449
without keeping the senate intact.

864
01:32:19,243 --> 01:32:22,578
If a special session of
Congress there is...

865
01:32:22,663 --> 01:32:25,998
easier for us to enter
the Jedi temple it will be.

866
01:33:04,455 --> 01:33:06,456
R2, stay with the ship.

867
01:33:31,857 --> 01:33:34,901
Welcome, Lord Vader.
We've been expecting you.

868
01:34:06,725 --> 01:34:11,270
And the Jedi rebellion has been foiled.

869
01:34:11,355 --> 01:34:12,438
What's happened?

870
01:34:12,523 --> 01:34:17,068
The chancellor's been elaborating on a
plot by the Jedi to overthrow the senate.

871
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:22,657
The remaining Jedi will be
hunted down and defeated.

872
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:40,925
Not even the younglings survived.

873
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:47,390
Killed not by clones this Padawan.

874
01:34:48,392 --> 01:34:51,060
By a lightsaber he was.

875
01:34:57,901 --> 01:34:59,485
Who?

876
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:01,487
Who could have done this?

877
01:35:12,165 --> 01:35:15,376
The attempt on my life...

878
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:20,381
has left me scarred and deformed.

879
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:24,218
But I assure you.

880
01:35:24,303 --> 01:35:29,056
My resolve has never been stronger!

881
01:35:33,228 --> 01:35:34,478
Stop!

882
01:35:47,409 --> 01:35:53,080
In order to ensure the security
and continuing stability...

883
01:35:53,165 --> 01:35:57,084
the Republic will be reorganized...

884
01:35:57,169 --> 01:36:02,673
into the first Galactic Empire!

885
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:09,430
For a safe and secure society.

886
01:36:18,815 --> 01:36:20,900
So this is how liberty dies.

887
01:36:21,610 --> 01:36:24,362
With thunderous applause.

888
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:28,949
The war is over.

889
01:36:29,034 --> 01:36:33,204
Lord Sidious promised us peace.
We only want...

890
01:36:41,296 --> 01:36:46,008
I have recalibrated the code,
warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.

891
01:36:46,093 --> 01:36:48,552
For the clones...

892
01:36:48,637 --> 01:36:52,765
to discover the recalibration
a long time it will take.

893
01:37:05,070 --> 01:37:06,570
Wait. Master.

894
01:37:08,073 --> 01:37:10,449
There is something I must know.

895
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:21,001
If into the security recordings you go,
only pain will you find.

896
01:37:21,086 --> 01:37:23,671
I must know the truth, Master.

897
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:33,389
It can't be.

898
01:37:33,473 --> 01:37:35,391
It can't be.

899
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:39,562
You have done well, my new apprentice.

900
01:37:39,646 --> 01:37:42,690
Now, Lord Vader...

901
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:46,318
go and bring peace to the Empire.

902
01:37:46,403 --> 01:37:48,612
I can't watch any more.

903
01:37:49,322 --> 01:37:53,284
Destroy the Sith we must.

904
01:37:55,036 --> 01:37:57,163
Send me to kill the emperor.

905
01:37:57,247 --> 01:37:59,540
I will not kill Anakin.

906
01:37:59,624 --> 01:38:04,378
To fight this Lord Sidious,
strong enough you are not.

907
01:38:04,463 --> 01:38:07,757
He is like my brother. I cannot do it.

908
01:38:08,467 --> 01:38:13,554
Twisted by the dark side
young Skywalker has become.

909
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:17,057
The boy you trained, gone he is.

910
01:38:17,142 --> 01:38:20,060
Consumed by Darth Vader.

911
01:38:20,145 --> 01:38:23,189
I do not know where the
emperor has sent him.

912
01:38:23,273 --> 01:38:25,524
I don't know where to look.

913
01:38:26,818 --> 01:38:30,529
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan,
and find him you will.

914
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:43,083
When was the last time you saw him?

915
01:38:43,752 --> 01:38:47,171
- Yesterday.
- And do you know where he is now?

916
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:53,677
Padmé, I need your help.

917
01:38:54,346 --> 01:38:57,014
- He is in grave danger.
- From the Sith?

918
01:38:57,766 --> 01:38:59,266
From himself.

919
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:06,106
Anakin has turned to the dark side.

920
01:39:06,191 --> 01:39:09,693
You're wrong. How could you even say that?

921
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:17,493
I have seen a security hologram...
of him...

922
01:39:19,079 --> 01:39:20,830
killing younglings.

923
01:39:20,914 --> 01:39:23,999
Not Anakin. He couldn't.

924
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:27,044
He was deceived by a lie. We all were.

925
01:39:27,879 --> 01:39:31,674
It appears that the chancellor
is behind everything, including the war.

926
01:39:33,468 --> 01:39:36,220
Palpatine is the Sith lord
we've been looking for.

927
01:39:36,304 --> 01:39:40,432
After the death of Count Dooku,
Anakin became his new apprentice.

928
01:39:46,606 --> 01:39:48,607
I don't believe you.

929
01:39:49,985 --> 01:39:51,485
I can't.

930
01:39:59,661 --> 01:40:01,954
I must find him.

931
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:06,417
You're going to kill him, aren't you?

932
01:40:10,088 --> 01:40:12,590
He has become a very great threat.

933
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:16,677
I can't.

934
01:40:30,358 --> 01:40:32,318
Anakin is the father, isn't he?

935
01:40:36,698 --> 01:40:38,699
I'm so sorry.

936
01:41:24,496 --> 01:41:26,747
- Milady, let me come with you.
- There's no danger.

937
01:41:26,831 --> 01:41:29,041
The fighting's over. And this is personal.

938
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:31,543
As you wish, milady, but
I strongly disagree.

939
01:41:31,628 --> 01:41:35,297
I'll be all right, Captain.
This is something I must do myself.

940
01:41:35,382 --> 01:41:37,800
Besides, 3PO will look after me.

941
01:41:40,011 --> 01:41:41,512
Oh, dear.

942
01:41:53,441 --> 01:41:57,111
Do you know? I think I'm beginning to
get the hang of this flying business.

943
01:42:25,432 --> 01:42:28,892
The separatists have been
taken care of, my master.

944
01:42:28,977 --> 01:42:31,895
It is finished then.

945
01:42:33,273 --> 01:42:39,111
You have restored peace
and justice to the galaxy.

946
01:42:39,863 --> 01:42:44,116
Send a message to the ships
of the Trade Federation.

947
01:42:44,909 --> 01:42:49,413
All droid units must shut down immediately.

948
01:42:50,248 --> 01:42:52,249
Very good, my lord.

949
01:43:51,476 --> 01:43:53,602
I saw your ship.

950
01:43:56,397 --> 01:43:59,441
- What are you doing out here?
- I was so worried about you.

951
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:03,737
Obi-Wan told me terrible things.

952
01:44:03,822 --> 01:44:05,405
What things?

953
01:44:06,074 --> 01:44:09,034
He said you've turned to the dark side.

954
01:44:09,119 --> 01:44:13,789
That you... killed younglings.

955
01:44:15,291 --> 01:44:18,001
Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.

956
01:44:18,086 --> 01:44:20,003
He cares about us.

957
01:44:20,672 --> 01:44:21,880
Us?

958
01:44:21,965 --> 01:44:23,465
He knows.

959
01:44:24,801 --> 01:44:26,718
He wants to help you.

960
01:44:30,515 --> 01:44:33,809
Anakin, all I want is your love.

961
01:44:33,893 --> 01:44:36,270
Love won't save you, Padmé.

962
01:44:36,354 --> 01:44:39,606
- Only my new powers can do that.
- At what cost?

963
01:44:39,691 --> 01:44:42,109
You're a good person. Don't do this.

964
01:44:42,193 --> 01:44:44,945
I won't lose you the way I lost my mother.

965
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:49,283
I am becoming more powerful
than any Jedi has ever dreamed of.

966
01:44:49,367 --> 01:44:52,202
And I'm doing it for you. To protect you.

967
01:44:53,496 --> 01:44:55,497
Come away with me.

968
01:44:56,207 --> 01:44:58,250
Help me raise our child.

969
01:44:58,334 --> 01:45:01,170
Leave everything else behind
while we still can.

970
01:45:01,254 --> 01:45:05,215
Don't you see?
We don't have to run away anymore.

971
01:45:06,009 --> 01:45:08,552
I have brought peace to the Republic.

972
01:45:09,554 --> 01:45:11,513
I am more powerful than the chancellor.

973
01:45:11,598 --> 01:45:13,724
I can overthrow him.

974
01:45:15,768 --> 01:45:18,854
And together, you and I
can rule the galaxy...

975
01:45:18,938 --> 01:45:21,398
make things the way we want them to be.

976
01:45:27,697 --> 01:45:29,740
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

977
01:45:31,201 --> 01:45:34,536
Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.

978
01:45:36,706 --> 01:45:39,583
I don't want to hear any
more about Obi-Wan.

979
01:45:40,418 --> 01:45:43,879
The Jedi turned against me.
Don't you turn against me.

980
01:45:45,548 --> 01:45:47,591
I don't know you anymore.

981
01:45:51,262 --> 01:45:53,263
You're breaking my heart.

982
01:45:53,932 --> 01:45:56,934
You're going down a path I can't follow.

983
01:45:57,894 --> 01:45:59,811
Because of Obi-Wan?

984
01:46:00,563 --> 01:46:02,689
Because of what you've done.

985
01:46:02,774 --> 01:46:04,733
What you plan to do.

986
01:46:05,944 --> 01:46:08,612
Stop. Stop now. Come back.

987
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:11,657
- I love you.
- Liar!

988
01:46:16,454 --> 01:46:20,249
You're with him!
You brought him here to kill me.

989
01:46:21,668 --> 01:46:23,293
Let her go, Anakin.

990
01:46:26,464 --> 01:46:28,674
Let her go.

991
01:46:38,643 --> 01:46:40,686
You turned her against me!

992
01:46:42,272 --> 01:46:44,481
You have done that yourself.

993
01:46:49,195 --> 01:46:51,405
You will not take her from me!

994
01:46:51,489 --> 01:46:55,367
Your anger and your lust for power
have already done that.

995
01:46:59,289 --> 01:47:03,667
You have allowed this dark lord
to twist your mind...

996
01:47:05,211 --> 01:47:08,422
until now you have become
the very thing you swore to destroy.

997
01:47:08,506 --> 01:47:10,424
Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan.

998
01:47:10,508 --> 01:47:13,051
I see through the lies of the Jedi.

999
01:47:14,137 --> 01:47:16,555
I do not fear the dark side as you do.

1000
01:47:18,349 --> 01:47:20,309
I have brought peace...

1001
01:47:20,393 --> 01:47:25,188
freedom, justice and security
to my new empire.

1002
01:47:26,149 --> 01:47:28,317
Your new empire?

1003
01:47:29,110 --> 01:47:31,194
Don't make me kill you.

1004
01:47:32,530 --> 01:47:37,075
Anakin, my allegiance is to
the Republic, to democracy!

1005
01:47:37,910 --> 01:47:39,911
If you're not with me...

1006
01:47:40,788 --> 01:47:42,706
then you're my enemy.

1007
01:47:44,709 --> 01:47:47,210
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.

1008
01:47:49,714 --> 01:47:51,631
I will do what I must.

1009
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:54,718
You will try.

1010
01:48:26,459 --> 01:48:30,504
I hear a new apprentice you have, Emperor.

1011
01:48:30,588 --> 01:48:35,092
Or should I call you Darth Sidious?

1012
01:48:35,176 --> 01:48:37,803
Master Yoda.

1013
01:48:37,887 --> 01:48:39,596
You survived.

1014
01:48:40,431 --> 01:48:41,848
Surprised?

1015
01:48:42,517 --> 01:48:47,145
Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda.

1016
01:48:47,230 --> 01:48:49,314
Now you will experience...

1017
01:48:49,399 --> 01:48:53,902
the full power of the dark side.

1018
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:41,533
I have waited a long
time for this moment...

1019
01:49:41,617 --> 01:49:46,830
my little green friend.

1020
01:49:57,008 --> 01:50:00,510
At last the Jedi are no more.

1021
01:50:00,595 --> 01:50:04,848
Not if anything to say about it I have.

1022
01:50:10,146 --> 01:50:12,522
At an end your rule is.

1023
01:50:14,358 --> 01:50:16,860
And not short enough it was.

1024
01:50:21,574 --> 01:50:23,825
If so powerful you are...

1025
01:50:25,036 --> 01:50:26,536
why leave?

1026
01:50:27,455 --> 01:50:30,040
You will not stop me.

1027
01:50:30,124 --> 01:50:34,753
Darth Vader will become
more powerful than either of us.

1028
01:50:34,837 --> 01:50:39,216
Faith in your new apprentice
misplaced may be.

1029
01:50:40,510 --> 01:50:44,596
As is your faith
in the dark side of the Force.

1030
01:55:12,198 --> 01:55:14,949
Hurry. Careful timing we will need.

1031
01:55:15,034 --> 01:55:17,869
Activate your homing
beacon when you're ready.

1032
01:55:17,953 --> 01:55:20,330
There's no sign of his body, sir.

1033
01:55:20,414 --> 01:55:24,083
- Then he is not dead.
- Double your search.

1034
01:55:24,168 --> 01:55:26,461
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

1035
01:55:27,505 --> 01:55:31,633
Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle
for immediate takeoff.

1036
01:55:31,717 --> 01:55:36,846
- Yes, Master.
- I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

1037
01:56:45,624 --> 01:56:48,835
Into exile I must go.

1038
01:56:49,503 --> 01:56:51,629
Failed I have.

1039
01:58:31,021 --> 01:58:32,981
I have failed you, Anakin.

1040
01:58:33,065 --> 01:58:34,983
I have failed you.

1041
01:58:35,067 --> 01:58:37,986
I should have known the Jedi
were plotting to take over.

1042
01:58:38,070 --> 01:58:40,905
Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!

1043
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:43,658
From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.

1044
01:58:43,742 --> 01:58:45,368
Then you are lost!

1045
01:58:57,214 --> 01:58:59,757
This is the end for you, my master.

1046
01:59:24,241 --> 01:59:27,410
It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.

1047
01:59:30,039 --> 01:59:32,749
You underestimate my power.

1048
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:35,251
Don't try it.

1049
01:59:58,108 --> 02:00:00,109
You were the chosen one!

1050
02:00:01,570 --> 02:00:04,781
It was said that you would destroy
the Sith, not join them!

1051
02:00:07,409 --> 02:00:11,245
Bring balance to the Force,
not leave it in darkness!

1052
02:00:22,883 --> 02:00:25,259
I hate you!

1053
02:00:32,643 --> 02:00:34,977
You were my brother, Anakin.

1054
02:00:36,980 --> 02:00:39,357
I loved you.

1055
02:01:20,357 --> 02:01:23,317
Master Kenobi. We have Miss Padmé on board.

1056
02:01:23,402 --> 02:01:25,528
Yes. Please, please hurry.

1057
02:01:25,612 --> 02:01:28,489
We should leave this dreadful place.

1058
02:01:44,006 --> 02:01:46,007
Is Anakin all right?

1059
02:02:54,785 --> 02:02:56,786
Your Majesty, this way.

1060
02:02:57,704 --> 02:02:59,622
There he is.

1061
02:02:59,706 --> 02:03:01,916
He's still alive.

1062
02:03:04,878 --> 02:03:07,129
Get a medical capsule immediately.

1063
02:03:07,214 --> 02:03:09,215
Yes, sir. Right away.

1064
02:03:45,168 --> 02:03:47,128
Excuse me, Master Yoda.

1065
02:03:53,010 --> 02:03:55,219
Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.

1066
02:04:12,029 --> 02:04:14,488
We'll take her to the medical center.
Quickly.

1067
02:04:44,770 --> 02:04:47,021
Medically, she's completely healthy.

1068
02:04:47,105 --> 02:04:50,358
For reasons we can't explain,
we are losing her.

1069
02:04:51,693 --> 02:04:54,445
- She's dying?
- We don't know why.

1070
02:04:54,529 --> 02:04:56,614
She has lost the will to live.

1071
02:04:56,698 --> 02:04:59,867
We need to operate quickly
if we are to save the babies.

1072
02:04:59,951 --> 02:05:01,577
Babies?

1073
02:05:01,661 --> 02:05:03,579
She's carrying twins.

1074
02:05:45,705 --> 02:05:47,206
Luke.

1075
02:05:55,382 --> 02:05:56,882
Oh, Luke.

1076
02:06:19,322 --> 02:06:21,699
- It's a girl.
- Leia.

1077
02:07:11,124 --> 02:07:13,042
There's good in him.

1078
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:17,129
I know.

1079
02:07:17,797 --> 02:07:21,425
I know there's... still...

1080
02:07:56,628 --> 02:07:58,128
Lord Vader.

1081
02:07:59,422 --> 02:08:01,590
Can you hear me?

1082
02:08:04,594 --> 02:08:06,095
Yes, Master.

1083
02:08:09,182 --> 02:08:11,100
Where is Padmé?

1084
02:08:12,894 --> 02:08:14,812
Is she safe?

1085
02:08:15,897 --> 02:08:17,940
Is she all right?

1086
02:08:19,609 --> 02:08:24,196
It seems, in your anger, you killed her.

1087
02:08:25,198 --> 02:08:28,117
I? I couldn't have.

1088
02:08:28,201 --> 02:08:31,245
She was alive. I felt it!

1089
02:08:50,974 --> 02:08:53,475
No!

1090
02:09:05,155 --> 02:09:08,824
Hidden, safe the children must be kept.

1091
02:09:10,577 --> 02:09:14,163
We must take them somewhere where
the Sith will not sense their presence.

1092
02:09:16,666 --> 02:09:18,834
Split up they should be.

1093
02:09:19,502 --> 02:09:21,462
My wife and I will take the girl.

1094
02:09:23,006 --> 02:09:25,924
We've always talked of
adopting a baby girl.

1095
02:09:26,009 --> 02:09:28,302
She will be loved with us.

1096
02:09:29,179 --> 02:09:31,180
And what of the boy?

1097
02:09:32,098 --> 02:09:35,643
To Tatooine. To his family send him.

1098
02:09:37,437 --> 02:09:39,897
I will take the child and watch over him.

1099
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:49,031
Until the time is right, disappear we will.

1100
02:09:50,825 --> 02:09:54,453
Master Kenobi, wait a moment.

1101
02:09:55,955 --> 02:10:01,210
In your solitude on Tatooine,
training I have for you.

1102
02:10:02,504 --> 02:10:03,837
Training?

1103
02:10:03,922 --> 02:10:08,550
An old friend has learned
the path to immortality.

1104
02:10:10,553 --> 02:10:13,681
One who has returned from
the netherworld of the Force.

1105
02:10:13,765 --> 02:10:16,225
Your old master.

1106
02:10:16,893 --> 02:10:18,394
Qui-Gon?

1107
02:10:20,897 --> 02:10:24,191
How to commune with him I will teach you.

1108
02:10:25,652 --> 02:10:27,820
- Captain Antilles.
- Yes, Your Highness?

1109
02:10:27,904 --> 02:10:29,822
I'm placing these droids in your care.

1110
02:10:29,906 --> 02:10:31,824
Treat them well. Clean them up.

1111
02:10:31,908 --> 02:10:33,826
Have the protocol droid's mind wiped.

1112
02:10:33,910 --> 02:10:35,411
What?

1113
02:10:37,247 --> 02:10:39,248
Oh, no!

1114
02:20:02,645 --> 02:20:03,645
English - US


1
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,502
Did you hear that?

2
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:52,380
They shut down the main reactor.
We'll be destroyed for sure.

3
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:54,049
This is madness.

4
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,518
We're doomed.

5
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:10,148
There'll be no escape
for the princess this time.

6
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:14,944
What's that?

7
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,757
R2-D2, where are you?

8
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,776
At last. Where have you been?

9
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:21,988
They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do?

10
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,366
We'll be sent to the Kessel spice mines
or smashed into who knows what.

11
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,578
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

12
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:44,385
The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.

13
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:47,096
Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?

14
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:50,016
What have you done with those plans?

15
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,101
We intercepted no transmissions.

16
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:57,065
This is a consular ship.
We're on a diplomatic mission.

17
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:01,778
If this is a consular ship,
where is the ambassador?

18
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,743
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans!

19
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,788
And bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!

20
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,802
There's one. Set for stun.

21
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:33,184
She'll be all right.

22
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:35,186
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

23
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:39,274
Hey. You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.

24
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,317
You'll be deactivated for sure.

25
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,905
Don't call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease.

26
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,657
Come out, before somebody sees you.

27
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,245
Secret mission? What plans?

28
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,956
What are you talking about?
I'm not getting in there.

29
00:06:58,294 --> 00:07:00,545
I'm going to regret this.

30
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:11,014
- There goes another one.
- Hold your fire. There's no life-forms.

31
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,432
It must have short-circuited.

32
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:15,852
That's funny. The damage
doesn't look as bad from out here.

33
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,189
Are you sure this thing is safe?

34
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,627
Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold.

35
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:45,340
The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this.
When they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...

36
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:47,508
Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.

37
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,510
You weren't on
any mercy mission this time.

38
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:53,723
Several transmissions
were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.

39
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,684
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

40
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,811
I don't know what you're talking about.

41
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:01,898
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

42
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,859
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor.

43
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,903
Take her away!

44
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,742
Holding her is dangerous.

45
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:16,371
If word of this gets out, it could generate
sympathy for the rebellion in the senate.

46
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,831
I have traced the rebel spies to her.

47
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,626
Now she is my only link
to finding their secret base.

48
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,628
She'll die before
she'll tell you anything.

49
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,380
Leave that to me.

50
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:28,966
Send a distress signal, and then inform
the senate that all aboard were killed.

51
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:32,178
Lord Vader, the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship...

52
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,721
and no transmissions were made.

53
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:38,017
An escape pod was jettisoned during the
fighting, but no life-forms were aboard.

54
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:41,104
She must have hidden
the plans in the escape pod.

55
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:44,774
Send a detachment down to retrieve them.
See to it personally, Commander.

56
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,943
There'll be no one to stop us this time.

57
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,611
Yes, sir.

58
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:05,211
How did we get into this mess?

59
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,672
I really don't know how.

60
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,634
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.

61
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,849
I've got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen.

62
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,941
What a desolate place this is.

63
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,114
Where do you think you're going?

64
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,699
Well, I'm not going that way.

65
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,993
It's much too rocky.

66
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,495
This way is much easier.

67
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,998
What makes you think
there are settlements over there?

68
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,501
Don't get technical with me.

69
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,838
What mission? What are you talking about?

70
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:53,259
I've just about had enough of you.

71
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,303
Go that way.

72
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:58,222
You'll be malfunctioning within a day,
you nearsighted scrap pile.

73
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,975
And don't let me catch you
following me, begging for help...

74
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,560
because you won't get it.

75
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,743
No more adventures.

76
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,828
I'm not going that way.

77
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:57,740
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault.

78
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,952
He tricked me into going this way...

79
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:02,954
but he'll do no better.

80
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,334
Wait. What's that?

81
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,170
A transport. I'm saved.

82
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:13,005
Over here!

83
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,716
Hey! Hey!

84
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:19,262
Help! Please help!

85
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:50,765
R2?

86
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:58,564
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!

87
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,351
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.

88
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,312
Look, sir. Droids.

89
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,286
We stopped.

90
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,163
Wake up. Wake up!

91
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,713
We're doomed.

92
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,014
Do you think they'll melt us down?

93
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,989
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

94
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,574
Will this never end?

95
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:14,408
- Fine. Let's go.
- Luke!

96
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,993
Luke!

97
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:24,501
Luke, tell your uncle if he gets a
translator, be sure it speaks Bocce.

98
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:27,129
Doesn't look like we have much choice,
but I'll remind him.

99
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,434
Yeah, we'll take that red one.

100
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,478
No, not that one.

101
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:47,232
You. I suppose you're programmed
for etiquette and protocol.

102
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:51,320
Protocol? It's my primary function, sir.
I am well-versed in all the customs...

103
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,740
- I have no need for a protocol droid.
- Of course you haven't, sir.

104
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,576
Not in an environment such as this.
That's why I have been programmed...

105
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:01,705
I need a droid who understands
the binary language of moisture vaporators.

106
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,084
Vaporators? Sir, my first job
was programming binary load lifters...

107
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,336
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

108
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,965
- Can you speak Bocce?
- Of course. It's like a second language.

109
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,258
- All right. Shut up. I'll take this one.
- Shutting up, sir.

110
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:14,551
Luke!

111
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,682
Take these two to the garage.
I want them cleaned up before dinner.

112
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,685
But I was going into Tosche Station
to pick up some power converters.

113
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,020
You can waste time with your friends
when your chores are done.

114
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,689
Now come on. Get to it.

115
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:29,984
All right. Come on.

116
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,363
And the red one. Come on.

117
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,574
Come on, red. Let's go.

118
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,388
- Uncle Owen.
- Yeah?

119
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,224
This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.

120
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,727
Hey, what are you trying to push on us?

121
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:12,693
Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit
is in prime condition, a real bargain.

122
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,695
Uncle Owen, what about that one?

123
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,322
What about that blue one?
We'll take that one.

124
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,867
Take this away.

125
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,535
You'll be pleased with that one, sir.

126
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,538
He really is in first-class condition.
I've worked with him before.

127
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:25,622
Here he comes.

128
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,253
Okay. Let's go.

129
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,088
Don't you forget this.

130
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:36,675
Why I should stick my neck out for you
is quite beyond my capacity.

131
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,101
Thank the maker.
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

132
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:51,190
I've got such a bad case of dust
contamination, I can barely move.

133
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:52,900
It just isn't fair.

134
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:55,736
Biggs is right.
I'm never gonna get out of here.

135
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,363
Is there anything I might do to help?

136
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:01,658
No, not unless you can alter time,
speed up the harvest...

137
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,410
or teleport me off this rock.

138
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:05,079
I don't think so, sir.

139
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:08,207
I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable
about such things.

140
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,209
Not on this planet, anyway.

141
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:13,712
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

142
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:15,923
Well, if there's a bright center
to the universe...

143
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:18,258
you're on the planet
that it's farthest from.

144
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,302
I see, sir.

145
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,388
- You can call me Luke.
- I see, Sir Luke.

146
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:26,266
Just Luke.

147
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:30,104
And I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.

148
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,856
And this is my counterpart, R2-D2.

149
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:33,982
Hello.

150
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:39,113
You got a lot of carbon scoring here.
Looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.

151
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:40,405
With all we've been through...

152
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,741
sometimes I'm amazed
we're in as good condition as we are...

153
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,493
what with the rebellion and all.

154
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,537
You know of the rebellion
against the Empire?

155
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:49,456
That's how we came to be in your service,
if you take my meaning, sir.

156
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,459
- Have you been in many battles?
- Several, I think.

157
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,461
There's not much to tell.

158
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:58,132
I'm not much more than an interpreter
and not very good at telling stories.

159
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:00,759
Well, not at making them
interesting, anyway.

160
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,387
Well, my little friend...

161
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,556
you got something jammed
in here real good.

162
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,141
Were you on a Starcruiser or...

163
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:11,061
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

164
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:12,771
What's this?

165
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:15,983
"What is what"?
He asked you a question. What is that?

166
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:20,028
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

167
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:27,369
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

168
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,874
He says it's nothing, sir,
merely a malfunction.

169
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,293
Old data. Pay it no mind.

170
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:36,461
Who is she? She's beautiful.

171
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:39,923
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

172
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:42,176
I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.

173
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,261
A person of some importance, I believe.

174
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,763
- Our captain was...
- Is there any more to this recording?

175
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:52,102
Behave yourself, R2.
You're going to get us into trouble.

176
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:54,980
It's all right. You can trust him.
He's our new master.

177
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,732
You're my only hope.

178
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:02,738
He says he's the property of Obi-Wan
Kenobi, a resident of these parts...

179
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,615
and it's a private message for him.

180
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,742
Frankly, I don't know
what he's talking about.

181
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,827
Our last master was Captain Antilles.

182
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:13,582
But with all we've been through,
this R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.

183
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,835
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.

184
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,588
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know
what he's talking about?

185
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,132
I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan...

186
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:25,093
but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea.

187
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,970
He's kind of a strange old hermit.

188
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:30,098
I wonder who she is.

189
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:33,101
Sounds like she's in trouble.
I better play back the whole thing.

190
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:40,150
He says the restraining bolt has
short-circuited his recording system.

191
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:43,070
He suggests that if you remove the bolt...

192
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:45,906
he might be able to play back
the entire recording.

193
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,116
Oh, yeah. Well...

194
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:51,703
I guess you're too small
to run away on me if I take this off.

195
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:52,996
Okay.

196
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,501
There you go.

197
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:02,381
Where'd she go? Bring her back.
Play back the entire message.

198
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:03,465
"What message"?

199
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:05,884
The one you've just been playing.

200
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,136
The one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards.

201
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:10,555
Luke! Luke!

202
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,891
I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.

203
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:16,103
I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.

204
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:19,648
Here. See what you can do with him.
I'll be right back.

205
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:25,153
Just you reconsider
playing that message for him.

206
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:28,115
No, I don't think he likes you at all.

207
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,159
No, I don't like you either.

208
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:43,714
- I think that R2 unit might have been stolen.
- What makes you think that?

209
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:46,758
I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.

210
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:49,344
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

211
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,225
I thought he might have meant old Ben.
Do you know what he's talking about?

212
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:59,521
I wonder if he's related to Ben.

213
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,398
That wizard's just a crazy old man.

214
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:06,403
Tomorrow, take that R2 unit to Anchorhead
and have its memory erased.

215
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,572
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.

216
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:12,951
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?

217
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,161
He won't.

218
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:19,124
I don't think he exists anymore.
He died about the same time as your father.

219
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,336
- He knew my father?
- I told you to forget it.

220
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:26,465
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.

221
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:30,510
In the morning, I want them on the south
ridge, working on those condensers.

222
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,679
Yes, sir.

223
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,516
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.

224
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:39,978
In fact, I was also thinking
about our agreement...

225
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:41,855
about me staying on another season.

226
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:47,569
If these new droids work out,
I want to apply to the academy this year.

227
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,405
You mean the next semester
before the harvest?

228
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,324
Sure. There's more than enough droids.

229
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,451
Harvest is when I need you the most.

230
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,578
It's only one season more.

231
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:59,831
This year we'll make enough
on the harvest to hire more hands...

232
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:02,209
and then you can go
to the academy next year.

233
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,170
You must understand I need you here, Luke.

234
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:08,173
- But it's a whole 'nother year.
- It's only one more season.

235
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,342
That's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

236
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,928
- Where are you going?
- Looks like I'm going nowhere.

237
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,805
I have to go finish cleaning those droids.

238
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:18,266
Owen, he can't stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone.

239
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:20,394
It means so much to him.

240
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:23,480
I'll make it up to him next year.
I promise.

241
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:29,111
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
He has too much of his father in him.

242
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:31,405
That's what I'm afraid of.

243
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,748
- What are you doing hiding back there?
- It wasn't my fault, sir.

244
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,625
Please don't deactivate me.

245
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,378
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.

246
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:31,673
- Kept babbling on about his mission.
- Oh, no.

247
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:42,559
That R2 unit has always been a problem.

248
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:45,270
These astro droids
are getting quite out of hand.

249
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,606
Even I can't understand
their logic at times.

250
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,400
How could I be so stupid?
He's nowhere in sight.

251
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:51,443
Blast it!

252
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,154
Pardon me, sir, but
couldn't we go after him?

253
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:57,449
It's too dangerous with the Sandpeople around.
We'll have to wait till morning.

254
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,534
Luke, I'm shutting the power down.

255
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,578
I'll be there in a few minutes.

256
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,747
Boy, am I gonna get it.

257
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:06,833
That little droid's gonna cause me
a lot of trouble.

258
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:08,877
He excels at that, sir.

259
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:11,505
Come on.

260
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,485
Have you seen Luke this morning?

261
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,988
He said he had things to do before
he started today, so he left early.

262
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:40,158
- Did he take those new droids with him?
- I think so.

263
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,662
He better have those units in
the south range repaired by midday...

264
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,413
or there'll be hell to pay.

265
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,000
There's a droid on the scanner.
Dead ahead.

266
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:52,087
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator.

267
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,570
Where do you think you're going?

268
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:19,406
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.

269
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,492
We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

270
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:25,328
Don't talk to me of your mission either.

271
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:28,540
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you
into a million pieces right here.

272
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,667
No. It's all right,
but I think we'd better go.

273
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,295
What's wrong with him now?

274
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,464
There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

275
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:39,134
Sandpeople. Or worse.

276
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:42,721
Come on. Let's go have a look.

277
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:43,805
Come on.

278
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:50,270
Well, there are two Banthas down there,
but I don't see any...

279
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,147
Wait a second.

280
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:55,108
They're Sandpeople, all right.
I can see one of them now.

281
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:10,934
Hello there.

282
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:16,606
Come here, my little friend.
Don't be afraid.

283
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,069
Don't worry. He'll be all right.

284
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:29,786
Rest easy, son. You've had a busy day.

285
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:33,581
You're fortunate to be all in one piece.

286
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:39,045
Ben? Ben Kenobi?

287
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,131
Boy, am I glad to see you.

288
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:44,259
The Jundland Wastes
are not to be traveled lightly.

289
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:50,974
Tell me, young Luke,
what brings you out this far?

290
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:53,309
This little droid.

291
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,938
I think he's searching
for his former master...

292
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,149
but I've never seen
such devotion in a droid before.

293
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:04,320
He claims to be the property
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

294
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:07,031
Is he a relative of yours?
Do you know who he's talking about?

295
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:10,243
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

296
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,122
Obi-Wan.

297
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,043
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.

298
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,629
A long time.

299
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,717
I think my uncle knows him.
He said he was dead.

300
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:27,510
He's not dead.

301
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:28,803
Not yet.

302
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:31,890
- You know him?
- Of course I know him.

303
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:33,349
He's me.

304
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:39,314
I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan...

305
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,066
since, oh, before you were born.

306
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:43,777
Then the droid does belong to you.

307
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:46,529
I don't seem to remember
ever owning a droid.

308
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:49,866
Very interesting.

309
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:53,828
I think we better get indoors.

310
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:57,207
The Sandpeople are easily startled...

311
00:31:57,291 --> 00:32:00,126
but they'll soon be back...
and in greater numbers.

312
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,339
3PO.

313
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,392
Where am I? I must have taken a bad step.

314
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:21,105
Can you stand? We've gotta get out
of here before the Sandpeople return.

315
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,942
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.

316
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:28,071
There's no sense in you risking yourself
on my account. I'm done for.

317
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,032
No, you're not. What kind of talk is that?

318
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,034
Quickly. They're on the move.

319
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:41,709
My father didn't fight in the wars.
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.

320
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:45,547
That's what your uncle told you.
He didn't hold with your father's ideals.

321
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:48,758
Thought he should have stayed here
and not gotten involved.

322
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:51,803
- You fought in the Clone Wars?
- Yes.

323
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:55,557
I was once a Jedi knight,
the same as your father.

324
00:32:58,102 --> 00:32:59,853
I wish I'd known him.

325
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:02,689
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy...

326
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:05,483
and a cunning warrior.

327
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:08,111
I understand you've become
quite a good pilot yourself.

328
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,115
And he was a good friend.

329
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:14,284
Which reminds me...

330
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,495
I have something here for you.

331
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:22,125
Your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough...

332
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,919
but your uncle wouldn't allow it.

333
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,881
He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan...

334
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:31,426
on some damn-fool idealistic crusade,
like your father did.

335
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,470
Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
I'll close down for a while.

336
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:36,139
Sure. Go ahead.

337
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:42,228
- What is it?
- Your father's lightsaber.

338
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,606
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

339
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:48,526
Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.

340
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,779
An elegant weapon...

341
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:54,866
for a more civilized age.

342
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:59,120
For over a thousand generations,
the Jedi knights...

343
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:03,166
were the guardians of
peace and justice in the old Republic...

344
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,002
before the dark times...

345
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,795
before the Empire.

346
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,759
How did my father die?

347
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,764
A young Jedi named Darth Vader...

348
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:20,433
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil...

349
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:24,520
helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi knights.

350
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:28,775
He betrayed and murdered your father.

351
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,820
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

352
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:37,784
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

353
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:39,452
The Force?

354
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:43,206
The Force is what gives a Jedi his power.

355
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:46,417
It's an energy field
created by all living things.

356
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:49,087
It surrounds us and penetrates us.

357
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:51,214
It binds the galaxy together.

358
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,848
Let's see if we can't figure out
what you are, my little friend...

359
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:04,185
and where you come from.

360
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:07,438
- I saw part of a message...
- I seem to have found it.

361
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:11,859
General Kenobi, years ago you served
my father in the Clone Wars.

362
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:15,405
Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.

363
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:18,616
I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request in person.

364
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:20,576
But my ship has fallen under attack...

365
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:22,954
and I'm afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.

366
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:26,332
I have placed information
vital to the survival of the rebellion...

367
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:28,501
into the memory systems of this R2 unit.

368
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,420
My father will know how to retrieve it.

369
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:34,382
You must see this droid
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.

370
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,718
This is our most desperate hour.

371
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,847
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

372
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:59,866
You must learn the ways of the Force
if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

373
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,409
Alderaan?

374
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,369
I'm not going to Alderaan.

375
00:36:03,454 --> 00:36:05,830
I've gotta get home.
It's late. I'm in for it as it is.

376
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:08,332
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.

377
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:11,586
I'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.

378
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:19,552
I can't get involved. I've got work to do.

379
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,180
It's not that I like the Empire.
I hate it.

380
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:24,849
But there's nothing
I can do about it right now.

381
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:29,854
- It's all such a long way from here.
- That's your uncle talking.

382
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:33,816
Oh, boy. My uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?

383
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:35,610
Learn about the Force, Luke.

384
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:44,994
I can take you as far as Anchorhead.

385
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:49,082
You can get a transport there
to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

386
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:53,294
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

387
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:04,472
Until this battle station is fully
operational, we are vulnerable.

388
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,724
The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.

389
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:08,726
They're more dangerous than you realize.

390
00:37:08,811 --> 00:37:11,729
Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander...

391
00:37:11,814 --> 00:37:13,523
not to this battle station.

392
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:17,235
The rebellion will continue to
gain support in the Imperial Senate...

393
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:21,030
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.

394
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:25,910
I've just received word that the emperor
has dissolved the council permanently.

395
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:29,664
The last remnants of the old Republic
have been swept away.

396
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:31,749
That's impossible.

397
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:34,127
How will the emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?

398
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:38,756
The regional governors now have
direct control over their territories.

399
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:43,136
Fear will keep the local systems in line.

400
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,346
Fear of this battle station.

401
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,597
And what of the rebellion?

402
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:49,934
If the rebels have obtained a complete
technical readout of this station...

403
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,978
it is possible, however unlikely...

404
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:54,188
that they might find a weakness
and exploit it.

405
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:58,526
The plans you refer to
will soon be back in our hands.

406
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,905
Any attack by the rebels against this
station would be a useless gesture...

407
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,991
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.

408
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:08,703
This station is now
the ultimate power in the universe.

409
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,122
I suggest we use it.

410
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:15,459
Don't be too proud of this
technological terror you've constructed.

411
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:18,963
The ability to destroy a planet
is insignificant...

412
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,882
next to the power of the Force.

413
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:24,427
Don't try to frighten us with
your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.

414
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:27,180
Your sad devotion
to that ancient religion...

415
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:30,057
has not helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes...

416
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:34,228
or given you clairvoyance enough
to find the rebels' hidden fortress...

417
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:44,071
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

418
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:47,909
Enough of this. Vader, release him.

419
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,452
As you wish.

420
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,748
This bickering is pointless.

421
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:58,628
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress...

422
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:00,796
by the time this station is operational.

423
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:04,634
We will then crush the rebellion
with one swift stroke.

424
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:16,187
It looks like the Sandpeople did this.
There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.

425
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,606
I've just never heard of them
hitting anything this big before.

426
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,026
They didn't, but we are
meant to think they did.

427
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,028
These tracks are side-by-side.

428
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:28,282
Sandpeople always ride single file
to hide their numbers.

429
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:31,244
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.

430
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:35,539
And these blast points,
too accurate for Sandpeople.

431
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:40,127
Only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.

432
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:42,755
But why would imperial troops
want to slaughter Jawas?

433
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:51,180
If they traced the robots here, they may
have learned who they sold them to...

434
00:39:51,265 --> 00:39:53,266
and that would lead them back... home.

435
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,642
Wait, Luke.

436
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,727
It's too dangerous.

437
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:22,712
Uncle Owen.

438
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:23,796
Aunt Beru.

439
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:26,048
Uncle Owen.

440
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:21,937
Now, Your Highness, we will discuss
the location of your hidden rebel base.

441
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,274
There's nothing you could have done,
had you been there.

442
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,027
You'd have been killed too...

443
00:42:10,112 --> 00:42:12,822
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.

444
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:16,617
I want to come with you to Alderaan.

445
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:19,370
There's nothing for me here now.

446
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:22,456
I want to learn the ways of the Force
and become a Jedi like my father.

447
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:40,516
Mos Eisley spaceport.

448
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:45,396
You will never find a more wretched hive
of scum and villainy.

449
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:47,857
We must be cautious.

450
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:31,108
How long have you had these droids?

451
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:34,361
- Three or four seasons.
- They're up for sale if you want them.

452
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:36,363
Let me see your identification.

453
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,742
You don't need to see his identification.

454
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:42,203
We don't need to see his identification.

455
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:44,830
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.

456
00:43:44,915 --> 00:43:46,874
These aren't the droids we're looking for.

457
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:50,419
He can go about his business.

458
00:43:50,504 --> 00:43:53,756
- You can go about your business.
- Move along.

459
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,425
Move along. Move along.

460
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:15,903
I can't abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures.

461
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:18,405
Go on, go on.

462
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,452
I can't understand how we got by those troops.
I thought we were dead.

463
00:44:23,537 --> 00:44:27,873
The Force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded.

464
00:44:31,253 --> 00:44:34,213
You really think we're gonna find
a pilot here to take us to Alderaan?

465
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:37,258
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here.

466
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:41,178
Only watch your step...
this place can be a little rough.

467
00:44:41,263 --> 00:44:43,013
I'm ready for anything.

468
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:48,269
Come along, R2.

469
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,323
- Hey. We don't serve their kind here.
- What?

470
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:45,367
Your droids... they'll have to wait outside.
We don't want them here.

471
00:45:45,452 --> 00:45:47,911
Wait out by the speeder.
We don't want any trouble.

472
00:45:47,996 --> 00:45:49,997
I heartily agree with you, sir.

473
00:45:59,633 --> 00:46:01,133
I'll have one of those.

474
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:39,046
- He doesn't like you.
- I'm sorry.

475
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:44,593
I don't like you either.
You just watch yourself.

476
00:46:44,678 --> 00:46:49,264
We're wanted men.
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.

477
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:52,184
- I'll be careful then.
- You'll be dead!

478
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:54,228
This little one's not worth the effort.

479
00:46:55,397 --> 00:46:56,563
Come, let me get you something.

480
00:47:24,217 --> 00:47:25,718
I'm all right.

481
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:31,598
Chewbacca here is first mate
on a ship that might suit us.

482
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:38,564
I don't like the look of this.

483
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:56,957
Han Solo. I'm captain
of the Millennium Falcon.

484
00:47:57,041 --> 00:48:00,252
Chewie here tells me you're looking
for passage to the Alderaan system.

485
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:02,671
Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.

486
00:48:02,756 --> 00:48:06,550
Fast ship? You've never heard of
the Millennium Falcon?

487
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:08,260
Should I have?

488
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:11,513
It's the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.

489
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:15,809
I've outrun imperial starships.

490
00:48:15,894 --> 00:48:17,895
Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.

491
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:20,147
I'm talking about
the big Corellian ships now.

492
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,984
She's fast enough for you, old man.

493
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:27,946
- What's the cargo?
- Only passengers...

494
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:30,866
myself, the boy, two droids...

495
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:33,952
and no questions asked.

496
00:48:35,163 --> 00:48:37,039
Is it some kind of local trouble?

497
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:42,336
Let's just say we'd like to avoid
any imperial entanglements.

498
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:46,507
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?

499
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,550
And it's gonna cost you something extra.

500
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:52,137
10,000, all in advance.

501
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:55,182
10,000?

502
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:59,019
We could almost buy our own ship for that.

503
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,355
But who's gonna fly it, kid? You?

504
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,524
You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot.

505
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:06,026
We don't have to sit here and listen...

506
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,987
We can pay you 2,000 now...

507
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:12,366
plus 15 when we reach Alderaan.

508
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:14,326
Seventeen?

509
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:20,290
Okay, you guys got yourselves a ship.

510
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,876
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
Docking Bay 94.

511
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:24,169
Ninety-four.

512
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:29,216
Looks like somebody's beginning
to take an interest in your handiwork.

513
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,886
All right. We'll check it out.

514
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:48,193
17,000. Those guys
must really be desperate.

515
00:49:48,278 --> 00:49:51,738
This could really save my neck.
Get back to the ship, get it ready.

516
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:54,867
- You'll have to sell your speeder.
- That's okay.

517
00:49:54,951 --> 00:49:56,994
I'm never coming back
to this planet again.

518
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,581
Going somewhere, Solo?

519
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:03,667
Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.

520
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:06,003
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

521
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:08,005
It's too late.

522
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:10,507
You should have paid him
when you had the chance.

523
00:50:10,592 --> 00:50:12,718
Jabba's put a price on
your head so large...

524
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:15,512
every bounty hunter in the galaxy
will be looking for you...

525
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,182
I'm lucky I found you first.

526
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:21,476
Yeah, but this time I've got the money.

527
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:25,147
If you give it to me, I
might forget I found you.

528
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:28,567
I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...

529
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:30,152
Jabba's through with you.

530
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,780
He has no time for smugglers...

531
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:36,533
who drop their shipments
at the first sign of an imperial cruiser.

532
00:50:36,618 --> 00:50:40,370
Even I get boarded sometimes.
Do you think I had a choice?

533
00:50:40,455 --> 00:50:44,583
You can tell that to Jabba.
He may only take your ship.

534
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:46,877
Over my dead body.

535
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:48,128
That's the idea.

536
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:52,215
I've been looking forward
to this for a long time.

537
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,634
I'll bet you have.

538
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,316
Sorry about the mess.

539
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:21,745
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.

540
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:25,248
It'll be some time before we can
extract any information from her.

541
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:28,919
The final checkout is completed.
All systems are operational.

542
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:31,254
What course shall we set?

543
00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:34,758
Perhaps she would respond
to an alternative form of persuasion.

544
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,468
What do you mean?

545
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:39,513
I think it is time we demonstrated
the full power of this station.

546
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:42,099
- Set your course for Alderaan.
- With pleasure.

547
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:45,310
Lock the door, R2.

548
00:51:47,397 --> 00:51:49,398
Check this side of the street.

549
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:56,196
The door's locked.
Move on to the next one.

550
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:05,747
I would much rather have gone with
Master Luke than stay here with you.

551
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:09,960
I don't know what this trouble is about,
but I'm sure it must be your fault.

552
00:52:10,712 --> 00:52:12,295
You watch your language.

553
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,883
All right. Give it to me. I'll take it.

554
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:21,304
Look at this. Ever since the XP-38
came out, they just aren't in demand.

555
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:23,390
It'll be enough.

556
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:45,328
Solo! Come out of there, Solo!

557
00:52:46,164 --> 00:52:48,165
Right here, Jabba.

558
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,917
I've been waitin' for you.

559
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:53,378
Have you now.

560
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:56,214
You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?

561
00:52:57,633 --> 00:53:02,095
Han, my boy, you disappoint me.

562
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:04,264
Why haven't you paid me...

563
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:07,768
and why did you fry poor Greedo?

564
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:10,604
Jabba, next time you wanna talk to me,
come see me yourself.

565
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:12,189
Don't send one of these twerps.

566
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:15,776
Han, I can't make exceptions.

567
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,737
What if everyone who smuggled for me...

568
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:21,406
dropped their cargo at the first sign...

569
00:53:21,491 --> 00:53:24,159
of an imperial starship?

570
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:26,161
It's not good business.

571
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:29,664
Look, Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes.

572
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:33,376
You think I had a choice?

573
00:53:33,461 --> 00:53:35,253
But I got a nice, easy charter.

574
00:53:35,338 --> 00:53:39,382
I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.
I just need a little more time.

575
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:44,638
Han, my boy, you're the best.

576
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:47,557
So, for an extra twenty percent...

577
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:49,643
Fifteen, Jabba. Don't push it.

578
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:51,812
Okay, fifteen percent.

579
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:54,064
But if you fail me again...

580
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:57,067
I'll put a price on your head so big...

581
00:53:57,151 --> 00:54:01,404
you won't be able to go
near a civilized system.

582
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:04,282
Jabba, you're a wonderful human being.

583
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:06,910
Come on!

584
00:54:12,834 --> 00:54:16,545
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting,
we ought to do well.

585
00:54:40,236 --> 00:54:42,154
What a piece of junk.

586
00:54:42,238 --> 00:54:44,781
She'll make .5 past light speed.

587
00:54:44,866 --> 00:54:47,659
She may not look like much,
but she's got it where it counts, kid.

588
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:50,745
I've made a lot of special
modifications myself.

589
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:54,749
But we're a little rushed, so if you'll
just get on board, we'll get outta here.

590
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:00,839
Hello, sir.

591
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:11,016
Which way?

592
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:15,020
All right, men, load your weapons.

593
00:55:16,606 --> 00:55:19,232
Stop that ship. Blast them.

594
00:55:29,035 --> 00:55:31,036
Chewie, get us out of here!

595
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:36,041
Oh, my. I'd forgotten
how much I hate space travel.

596
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:58,021
Looks like an imperial cruiser.
Our passengers are hotter than I thought.

597
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,522
Hold 'em off.
Angle the deflector shields...

598
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:01,733
while I make the calculations
for the jump to light speed.

599
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:15,372
Stay sharp. There's two more comin' in.
They're gonna try and cut us off.

600
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:17,540
Why don't you outrun 'em?
You said this thing was fast.

601
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:19,501
Watch your mouth or you're gonna
find yourself floating home.

602
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:23,004
We'll be safe enough
once we make the jump to hyperspace.

603
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:24,965
Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
We'll lose 'em.

604
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:31,096
Here's where the fun begins.

605
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,973
How long before you can
jump to light speed?

606
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:35,976
It'll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.

607
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,644
Are you kidding?
At the rate they're gaining?

608
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:40,772
Traveling through hyperspace
ain't like dustin' crops, boy.

609
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:43,316
Without precise calculations,
we'd fly right through a star...

610
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:47,028
or bounce too close to a supernova,
and that would end your trip real quick.

611
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:49,489
- What's that flashing?
- We're losing a deflector shield.

612
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:52,534
Go strap yourselves in.
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.

613
00:57:13,514 --> 00:57:15,849
We've entered the Alderaan system.

614
00:57:16,851 --> 00:57:20,812
Governor Tarkin. I should have expected
to find you holding Vader's leash.

615
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:24,566
I recognized your foul stench
when I was brought on board.

616
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:28,111
Charming to the last.

617
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:30,697
You don't know how hard I found it...

618
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,699
signing the order to terminate your life.

619
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:35,660
I'm surprised you had the courage
to take the responsibility yourself.

620
00:57:35,745 --> 00:57:38,913
Princess Leia, before your execution...

621
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:41,207
I would like you to be my guest
at a ceremony...

622
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:44,294
that will make
this battle station operational.

623
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:47,213
No star system will dare
oppose the emperor now.

624
00:57:47,882 --> 00:57:50,050
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin...

625
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:52,802
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.

626
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:55,638
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.

627
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:59,768
In a way, you have determined
the choice of the planet...

628
00:57:59,852 --> 00:58:01,978
that'll be destroyed first.

629
00:58:02,063 --> 00:58:06,608
Since you are reluctant to provide us
with the location of the rebel base...

630
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:09,486
I have chosen to test
this station's destructive power...

631
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:11,571
on your home planet of Alderaan.

632
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:15,325
No. Alderaan is peaceful.
We have no weapons.

633
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,744
You would prefer another target?
A military target?

634
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:20,080
Then name the system.

635
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:25,335
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.

636
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:28,088
Where is the rebel base?

637
00:58:31,634 --> 00:58:33,259
Dantooine.

638
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:35,720
They're on Dantooine.

639
00:58:35,805 --> 00:58:39,182
There. You see, Lord Vader?
She can be reasonable.

640
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:42,143
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.

641
00:58:42,228 --> 00:58:44,396
- What?
- You're far too trusting.

642
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,940
Dantooine is too remote
to make an effective demonstration.

643
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:51,611
But don't worry. We will deal with
your rebel friends soon enough.

644
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:56,116
Commence primary ignition.

645
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,641
Are you all right? What's wrong?

646
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,228
I felt a great disturbance in the Force...

647
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:28,523
as if millions of voices suddenly
cried out in terror...

648
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,567
and were suddenly silenced.

649
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:33,319
I fear something terrible has happened.

650
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:37,282
You'd better get on with your exercises.

651
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:42,245
You can forget your troubles
with those imperial slugs.

652
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:44,330
I told you I'd outrun them.

653
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:50,378
Don't everybody thank me at once.

654
00:59:50,463 --> 00:59:53,882
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 0200 hours.

655
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:04,434
Now be careful, R2.

656
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:16,404
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.

657
01:00:16,489 --> 01:00:18,656
Let him have it.
It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.

658
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:21,117
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.

659
01:00:21,202 --> 01:00:25,788
That's 'cause a droid don't pull people's
arms out of their sockets when they lose.

660
01:00:25,873 --> 01:00:28,082
Wookiees are known to do that.

661
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:31,628
I see your point, sir.

662
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:35,381
I suggest a new strategy, R2.
Let the Wookiee win.

663
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:57,487
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.

664
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:00,573
- You mean it controls your actions?
- Partially.

665
01:01:00,658 --> 01:01:02,575
But it also obeys your commands.

666
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:12,043
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are
no match for a blaster at your side, kid.

667
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:14,420
You don't believe in the Force, do you?

668
01:01:15,256 --> 01:01:17,674
Kid, I've flown from one side
of this galaxy to the other.

669
01:01:17,758 --> 01:01:19,676
I've seen a lot of strange stuff...

670
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,011
but I've never seen anything
to make me believe...

671
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:25,473
there's one all-powerful force
controlling everything.

672
01:01:25,558 --> 01:01:29,686
There's no mystical energy field
controls my destiny.

673
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:32,647
It's all a lot of
simple tricks and nonsense.

674
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:35,608
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

675
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:39,988
This time, let go your conscious self...

676
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:44,033
and act on instinct.

677
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:48,580
With the blast shield down, I can't see.
How am I supposed to fight?

678
01:01:48,664 --> 01:01:51,124
Your eyes can deceive you.
Don't trust them.

679
01:02:00,509 --> 01:02:02,844
Stretch out with your feelings.

680
01:02:17,276 --> 01:02:19,444
You see? You can do it.

681
01:02:19,528 --> 01:02:21,195
I call it luck.

682
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,906
In my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.

683
01:02:23,991 --> 01:02:26,242
Good against remotes is one thing.

684
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:29,329
Good against the living,
that's something else.

685
01:02:30,456 --> 01:02:32,457
We're coming up on Alderaan.

686
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:38,504
I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.

687
01:02:38,589 --> 01:02:43,009
That's good. You've taken
your first step into a larger world.

688
01:02:48,182 --> 01:02:49,766
Yes?

689
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:51,851
Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.

690
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:53,853
They found the remains of a rebel base...

691
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:56,314
but they estimate that
it has been deserted for some time.

692
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:59,776
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.

693
01:03:00,778 --> 01:03:03,363
She lied. She lied to us.

694
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:07,158
I told you she would never
consciously betray the rebellion.

695
01:03:08,494 --> 01:03:10,286
Terminate her immediately.

696
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:16,334
Stand by, Chewie. Here we go.
Cut in the sublight engines.

697
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:20,171
What the...

698
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:25,468
We've come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower...

699
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:26,969
some kind of asteroid collision.

700
01:03:27,054 --> 01:03:29,389
- It's not on any of the charts.
- What's going on?

701
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:31,808
Our position's correct,
except no Alderaan.

702
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:34,143
- Where is it?
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

703
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:36,062
It ain't there. It's been blown away.

704
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:38,856
- What? How?
- Destroyed by the Empire.

705
01:03:38,941 --> 01:03:41,150
The entire starfleet
couldn't destroy the whole planet.

706
01:03:41,235 --> 01:03:43,820
It'd take a thousand ships
with more firepower than I've...

707
01:03:45,364 --> 01:03:47,615
- There's another ship coming in.
- Maybe they know what happened.

708
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,033
It's an imperial fighter.

709
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:53,663
- It followed us.
- No. It's a short-range fighter.

710
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:55,915
There aren't any bases around here.
Where did it come from?

711
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:01,921
Sure is leaving in a hurry.
If they identify us, we're in trouble.

712
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:04,132
Not if I can help it.
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

713
01:04:04,216 --> 01:04:07,593
- Let it go. It's too far out of range.
- Not for long.

714
01:04:11,432 --> 01:04:14,684
A fighter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own.

715
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:17,437
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.

716
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:20,440
He ain't gonna be around
long enough to tell anybody about us.

717
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:24,819
He's heading for that small moon.

718
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:27,447
I can get him before he gets there.
He's almost in range.

719
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:31,117
That's no moon.

720
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:34,579
- It's a space station.
- It's too big to be a space station.

721
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:40,334
I have a very bad feeling about this.

722
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:42,295
Turn the ship around.

723
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:44,630
Yeah. I think you're right. Full reverse.

724
01:04:44,715 --> 01:04:46,799
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.

725
01:04:51,472 --> 01:04:53,639
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.

726
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,602
Why are we still moving towards it?

727
01:04:57,686 --> 01:04:59,520
We're caught in a tractor beam.
It's pulling us in.

728
01:04:59,605 --> 01:05:01,272
There's gotta be something you can do.

729
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:04,108
There's nothing I can do.
I'm at full power. I have to shut down.

730
01:05:04,193 --> 01:05:05,693
They're not gonna get me without a fight.

731
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,826
You can't win, but there are
alternatives to fighting.

732
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:32,595
Clear Bay 327.

733
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:35,056
We are opening the magnetic field.

734
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:51,572
To your stations. Come with me.

735
01:05:56,203 --> 01:05:59,622
Close all outboard shields.
Close all outboard shields.

736
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,291
Yes?

737
01:06:02,376 --> 01:06:05,378
We've captured a freighter entering
the remains of the Alderaan system.

738
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:09,298
Its markings match those of a ship
that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.

739
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:13,219
They must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.

740
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:16,389
She may yet be of some use to us.

741
01:06:21,395 --> 01:06:24,730
Unlock 1, 5, 7 and 9. Release charge.

742
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:33,990
There's no one on board, sir.

743
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:36,868
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after takeoff.

744
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:40,454
It must be a decoy.
Several escape pods have been jettisoned.

745
01:06:40,539 --> 01:06:42,498
- Did you find any droids?
- No, sir.

746
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:44,458
If there were any,
they must also have jettisoned.

747
01:06:44,543 --> 01:06:48,045
Send a scanning crew aboard.
I want every part of this ship checked.

748
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:49,380
Yes, sir.

749
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:51,048
I sense something...

750
01:06:51,133 --> 01:06:53,593
a presence I've not felt since...

751
01:06:56,305 --> 01:06:59,724
Get me a scanning crew in here.
I want every part of this ship checked.

752
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:10,693
There's no one here.

753
01:07:19,578 --> 01:07:21,704
Boy, it's lucky you have
these compartments.

754
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:24,916
I use them for smuggling. I never
thought I'd be smuggling myself in 'em.

755
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,208
This is ridiculous.

756
01:07:26,293 --> 01:07:28,836
Even if I could take off,
I'd never get past the tractor beam.

757
01:07:28,921 --> 01:07:30,254
Leave that to me.

758
01:07:30,339 --> 01:07:33,382
Damn fool. I knew you were gonna say that.

759
01:07:33,467 --> 01:07:36,969
Who's the more foolish,
the fool or the fool who follows him?

760
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:50,232
The ship's all yours. If the scanners
pick up anything, report it immediately.

761
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:53,319
All right. Let's go.

762
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:10,002
Hey, down there.

763
01:08:11,672 --> 01:08:13,673
Could you give us a hand with this?

764
01:08:22,057 --> 01:08:24,517
TK-421, why aren't you at your post?

765
01:08:25,686 --> 01:08:27,687
TK-421, do you copy?

766
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:42,660
Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.
I'll see what I can do.

767
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,888
Between his howling
and your blasting everything...

768
01:09:02,973 --> 01:09:05,016
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.

769
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:08,394
Bring 'em on. I prefer a straight fight
to sneakin' around.

770
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:10,271
We've found the computer outlet, sir.

771
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:13,399
Plug in. He should be able to
interpret the entire imperial network.

772
01:09:24,578 --> 01:09:28,080
He's found the controls to the power beam
that's holding the ship here.

773
01:09:28,165 --> 01:09:31,042
He'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.

774
01:09:31,126 --> 01:09:35,379
The tractor beam is coupled
to the main reactor in seven locations.

775
01:09:35,464 --> 01:09:38,507
A power loss at one of the terminals
will allow the ship to leave.

776
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:44,513
I don't think you boys can help.
I must go alone.

777
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:48,017
Whatever you say. I've done more than
I bargained for on this trip already.

778
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:51,979
- I want to go with you.
- Be patient, Luke. Watch the droids.

779
01:09:52,064 --> 01:09:54,023
They must be delivered safely...

780
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:57,318
or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan.

781
01:09:57,402 --> 01:10:00,738
Your destiny lies along
a different path from mine.

782
01:10:04,284 --> 01:10:06,285
The Force will be with you...

783
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:07,787
always.

784
01:10:17,297 --> 01:10:19,590
You said it, Chewie.

785
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:22,093
Where did you dig up that old fossil?

786
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:24,720
Ben is a great man.

787
01:10:24,805 --> 01:10:27,765
- Great at getting us into trouble.
- I didn't hear you give any ideas.

788
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:30,893
Anything's better than just hangin'
around waiting for 'em to pick us up.

789
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:33,312
Who do you think...

790
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:36,649
- What is it?
- I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

791
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:39,318
He says, "I've found her,"
and keeps repeating, "She's here."

792
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:42,029
Who? Who has he found?

793
01:10:42,114 --> 01:10:44,865
- Princess Leia.
- The princess? She's here?

794
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:46,659
- Princess?
- Where is she?

795
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:48,661
Princess? What's going on?

796
01:10:54,084 --> 01:10:56,877
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.

797
01:11:01,675 --> 01:11:04,343
I'm afraid she's scheduled
to be terminated.

798
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:07,429
Oh, no. We've gotta do something.

799
01:11:07,514 --> 01:11:09,974
- What are you talking about?
- The droids belong to her.

800
01:11:10,058 --> 01:11:11,976
She's the one in the message.
We gotta help her.

801
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:14,937
Don't get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait here.

802
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:18,315
He didn't know she was here.
Find a way into that detention block.

803
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,860
- I'm not going anywhere.
- They're gonna execute her.

804
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:24,530
You said you didn't want to just wait
to be captured. Now you want to stay?

805
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:27,700
Marching into the detention area
is not what I had in mind.

806
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:30,619
- But they're gonna kill her.
- Better her than me.

807
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:39,712
She's rich.

808
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:43,716
Rich?

809
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:48,429
Rich, powerful. If you were to
rescue her, the reward would be...

810
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:51,307
- What?
- Well, more well than you can imagine.

811
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:53,392
I don't know. I can imagine quite a bit.

812
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:55,561
- You'll get it.
- I better.

813
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,146
You will.

814
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:59,690
All right, kid.
You better be right about this.

815
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:01,775
- All right.
- What's your plan?

816
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:05,279
3PO, hand me those binders there,
will you?

817
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:08,240
Okay.

818
01:12:08,909 --> 01:12:10,868
Now, I'm gonna put these on you.

819
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:15,206
Okay, Han, you put those on.

820
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,751
Don't worry, Chewie.
I think I know what he has in mind.

821
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:21,253
Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking...

822
01:12:21,338 --> 01:12:24,590
but what should R2 and I do
if we're discovered here?

823
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:28,510
- Lock the door.
- And hope they don't have blasters.

824
01:12:28,595 --> 01:12:30,638
That isn't very reassuring.

825
01:12:50,951 --> 01:12:55,579
517 to scan control.
517 to scan control.

826
01:13:21,982 --> 01:13:24,316
I can't see a thing in this helmet.

827
01:13:55,724 --> 01:13:58,434
- This is not gonna work.
- Why didn't you say so before?

828
01:13:58,518 --> 01:14:00,519
I did say so before.

829
01:14:15,493 --> 01:14:18,704
Where are you taking this... thing?

830
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:21,540
Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138.

831
01:14:22,876 --> 01:14:24,793
I wasn't notified.

832
01:14:24,878 --> 01:14:26,879
I'll have to clear it.

833
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:35,763
- Look out! He's loose!
- He'll tear us all apart!

834
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:00,871
Look out.

835
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:13,884
We gotta find out which cell
this princess of yours is in.

836
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:16,178
Here it is... 2187. You go and get her.

837
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:18,263
I'll hold them here.

838
01:15:22,185 --> 01:15:24,812
Everything's under control.
Situation normal.

839
01:15:24,896 --> 01:15:26,105
What happened?

840
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:28,107
Had a slight weapons malfunction...

841
01:15:28,191 --> 01:15:30,526
but everything's perfectly all right now.

842
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:33,862
We're fine. We're all fine here now.
Thank you.

843
01:15:33,947 --> 01:15:36,615
- How are you?
- We're sending a squad up.

844
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:40,786
Negative, negative.
We have a reactor leak here now.

845
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:44,790
Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
Large leak, very dangerous.

846
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:47,459
Who is this? What's your operating number?

847
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:53,340
Boring conversation anyway.
Luke, we're gonna have company!

848
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:09,523
Aren't you a little short
for a stormtrooper?

849
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,401
Oh, the uniform.

850
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:15,904
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.

851
01:16:15,989 --> 01:16:19,032
- You're who?
- I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit.

852
01:16:19,117 --> 01:16:21,076
- I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
- Ben Kenobi? Where is he?

853
01:16:21,161 --> 01:16:22,244
Come on.

854
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:27,458
- He is here.
- Obi-Wan Kenobi?

855
01:16:28,168 --> 01:16:31,545
- What makes you think so?
- A tremor in the Force.

856
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:35,466
The last time I felt it
was in the presence of my old master.

857
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:38,010
Surely he must be dead by now.

858
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:40,512
Don't underestimate the Force.

859
01:16:41,556 --> 01:16:44,850
The Jedi are extinct.
Their fire has gone out of the universe.

860
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:48,270
You, my friend, are all that's left
of their religion.

861
01:16:49,063 --> 01:16:50,272
Yes.

862
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:53,859
We have an emergency alert
in Detention Block AA-23.

863
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:57,070
The princess? Put all sections on alert.

864
01:16:57,155 --> 01:17:00,866
Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

865
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:03,785
If you're right,
he must not be allowed to escape.

866
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:07,372
Escape is not his plan.
I must face him alone.

867
01:17:16,674 --> 01:17:18,217
Get behind me. Get behind me.

868
01:17:29,604 --> 01:17:32,397
Watch your left.
They went down the cell bay.

869
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:38,320
- Can't get out that way.
- You cut off our only escape route.

870
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:40,948
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.

871
01:17:43,493 --> 01:17:45,661
- C-3PO. C-3PO.
- Yes, sir?

872
01:17:45,745 --> 01:17:49,248
Are there any other ways out of
the cell bay? We've been cut off.

873
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:53,669
What was that? I didn't copy.

874
01:17:53,753 --> 01:17:57,214
I said all systems have been
alerted to your presence, sir.

875
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:59,841
The main entrance
seems to be the only way in or out.

876
01:17:59,926 --> 01:18:02,177
All other information on your level
is restricted.

877
01:18:02,262 --> 01:18:04,846
Open up in there. Open up in there.

878
01:18:05,807 --> 01:18:07,516
Oh, no.

879
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,226
There isn't any other way out.

880
01:18:14,774 --> 01:18:16,984
I can't hold them off forever. Now what?

881
01:18:17,068 --> 01:18:20,612
This is some rescue. When you came in here,
didn't you have a plan for getting out?

882
01:18:20,697 --> 01:18:22,739
He's the brains, sweetheart.

883
01:18:22,824 --> 01:18:24,575
Well, I didn't...

884
01:18:25,702 --> 01:18:29,246
- What the hell are you doing?
- Somebody has to save our skins.

885
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:33,250
Into the garbage chute, flyboy.

886
01:18:40,717 --> 01:18:41,758
Get in there!

887
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:45,929
Get in there, you big furry oaf.
I don't care what you smell.

888
01:18:46,973 --> 01:18:49,474
Get in there, and don't worry about it.

889
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:52,978
Wonderful girl.

890
01:18:55,106 --> 01:18:58,317
Either I'm gonna kill her,
or I'm beginning to like her.

891
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:01,778
Get in there.

892
01:19:14,459 --> 01:19:17,919
The garbage chute was
a really wonderful idea.

893
01:19:18,004 --> 01:19:20,464
What an incredible smell
you've discovered.

894
01:19:23,009 --> 01:19:25,260
Let's get out of here.

895
01:19:25,345 --> 01:19:27,679
- Get away from there.
- No, wait.

896
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:36,897
Forget it! I already tried it!
It's magnetically sealed.

897
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:39,232
Put that thing away!
You're gonna get us all killed!

898
01:19:39,317 --> 01:19:41,276
Absolutely, Your Worship.

899
01:19:41,361 --> 01:19:43,695
Look, I had everything under control
till you led us down here.

900
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:46,740
It's not gonna take 'em long
to figure out what happened to us.

901
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:48,116
It could be worse.

902
01:19:52,664 --> 01:19:53,955
It's worse.

903
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:57,125
- There's something alive in here.
- That's your imagination.

904
01:19:58,044 --> 01:20:00,003
Something just moved past my leg.

905
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:04,758
- Look. Did you see that?
- What?

906
01:20:26,406 --> 01:20:27,906
Kid! Luke!

907
01:20:40,712 --> 01:20:42,421
Grab hold of this!

908
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:44,923
Blast it! My gun's jammed.

909
01:20:45,007 --> 01:20:47,759
- Where?
- Anywhere!

910
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:22,002
Help him!

911
01:21:22,086 --> 01:21:24,087
- What happened?
- I don't know.

912
01:21:24,172 --> 01:21:27,007
It just let go of me and disappeared.

913
01:21:33,014 --> 01:21:35,056
I got a bad feeling about this.

914
01:21:41,147 --> 01:21:44,316
- The walls are moving!
- Try and brace it with something.

915
01:21:53,284 --> 01:21:54,826
Help me.

916
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:09,216
Wait a minute.

917
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:14,304
3PO! Come in, 3PO!

918
01:22:15,515 --> 01:22:17,057
3PO!

919
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:19,184
Where could he be?

920
01:22:23,397 --> 01:22:25,565
Take over. See to him.

921
01:22:28,027 --> 01:22:29,528
Look, there.

922
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:34,324
They're madmen.
They're heading for the prison level.

923
01:22:34,408 --> 01:22:36,326
If you hurry, you might catch them.

924
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:37,911
Follow me.

925
01:22:41,624 --> 01:22:43,667
You stand guard.

926
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,214
Come on.

927
01:22:57,515 --> 01:23:00,809
All this excitement has overrun
the circuits in my counterpart here.

928
01:23:00,893 --> 01:23:04,020
If you don't mind, I'd like to
take him down to maintenance.

929
01:23:04,105 --> 01:23:05,689
All right.

930
01:23:17,869 --> 01:23:20,579
3PO. Come in, 3PO.

931
01:23:20,663 --> 01:23:21,955
3PO.

932
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:24,875
- Get on top.
- I can't.

933
01:23:24,959 --> 01:23:26,877
Where could he be? 3PO.

934
01:23:28,254 --> 01:23:30,088
3PO, will you come in?

935
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:33,091
They aren't here.
Something must have happened to them.

936
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:35,385
See if they've been captured. Hurry.

937
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:42,642
One thing's for sure.
We're all gonna be a lot thinner.

938
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:47,272
- Get on top of it.
- I'm trying.

939
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:55,989
Thank goodness they haven't found them.
Where could they be?

940
01:23:58,492 --> 01:24:00,869
"Use the comlink"? Oh, my.

941
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:02,913
I forgot. I turned it off.

942
01:24:07,084 --> 01:24:09,210
- Are you there, sir?
- 3PO?

943
01:24:10,171 --> 01:24:12,797
- We've had some problems.
- Shut up and listen to me.

944
01:24:12,882 --> 01:24:16,635
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level. Do you copy?

945
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:19,429
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

946
01:24:20,848 --> 01:24:23,516
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

947
01:24:23,601 --> 01:24:26,353
No, shut them all down. Hurry! Oh, no.

948
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:39,324
What?

949
01:24:40,368 --> 01:24:42,285
You did great, 3PO!

950
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:44,746
Listen to them. They're dying, R2.

951
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:46,831
Curse my metal body. I wasn't fast enough.

952
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:50,210
It's all my fault. My poor master.

953
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:51,878
We're all right. You did great!

954
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:56,675
Hey! Open the pressure maintenance hatch
on unit number... Where are we?

955
01:24:56,759 --> 01:25:00,136
3263827.

956
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:49,477
If we can avoid any more female advice,
we oughta be able to get out of here.

957
01:25:49,562 --> 01:25:51,438
Let's get moving.

958
01:25:52,606 --> 01:25:54,816
Where you goin'?

959
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,401
Wait! They'll hear!

960
01:25:58,404 --> 01:26:00,321
Come here, you big coward.

961
01:26:00,406 --> 01:26:02,073
- Chewie, come here.
- Listen.

962
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:05,702
I don't know who you are
or where you came from...

963
01:26:05,786 --> 01:26:08,621
but from now on,
you do as I tell you, okay?

964
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:12,459
Look, Your Worshipfulness,
let's get one thing straight.

965
01:26:12,543 --> 01:26:15,211
I take orders from just one person... me.

966
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:17,839
It's a wonder you're still alive.

967
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:21,134
Will somebody get
this big walking carpet out of my way?

968
01:26:21,218 --> 01:26:23,511
No reward is worth this.

969
01:26:33,731 --> 01:26:35,648
Give me regular reports, please.

970
01:26:35,733 --> 01:26:36,816
Right.

971
01:26:38,986 --> 01:26:42,280
- Do you know what's going on?
- Maybe it's another drill.

972
01:26:47,286 --> 01:26:49,329
You seen that new VT-16?

973
01:26:49,413 --> 01:26:51,873
Yeah. Some of the other guys
were telling me about it.

974
01:26:51,957 --> 01:26:53,875
They say it's quite a thing to see.

975
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:55,960
What was that?

976
01:26:56,045 --> 01:26:59,297
It's nothing. Outgassing.
Don't worry about it.

977
01:27:04,303 --> 01:27:06,346
- There she is.
- C-3PO, do you copy?

978
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:07,514
Yes, sir.

979
01:27:07,598 --> 01:27:09,474
- Are you safe?
- For the moment.

980
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:11,935
We're in the main hangar
across from the ship.

981
01:27:13,896 --> 01:27:15,522
We're right above you. Stand by.

982
01:27:15,606 --> 01:27:18,399
You came in that thing?
You're braver than I thought.

983
01:27:18,484 --> 01:27:20,485
Nice. Come on.

984
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:25,782
It's them. Blast them.

985
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:28,785
Get back to the ship!

986
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:30,829
- Where are you going?
- He certainly has courage.

987
01:27:30,913 --> 01:27:34,624
What good will it do us
if he gets himself killed? Come on.

988
01:27:59,525 --> 01:28:01,526
I think we took a wrong turn.

989
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:07,407
There's no lock.

990
01:28:11,495 --> 01:28:14,414
- That oughta hold them for a while.
- Quick. We've got to get across.

991
01:28:14,498 --> 01:28:17,667
- Find the controls to extend the bridge.
- I think I just blasted it.

992
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:19,544
They're coming through.

993
01:28:41,901 --> 01:28:43,568
Here, hold this.

994
01:28:59,752 --> 01:29:00,960
Here they come.

995
01:29:12,348 --> 01:29:13,890
For luck.

996
01:29:20,022 --> 01:29:24,025
We think they may be splitting up.
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.

997
01:29:38,832 --> 01:29:40,875
Where could they be?

998
01:29:44,588 --> 01:29:46,506
Close the blast doors.

999
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:56,099
Open the blast doors.
Open the blast doors.

1000
01:30:14,451 --> 01:30:19,247
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again at last.

1001
01:30:19,999 --> 01:30:21,708
The circle is now complete.

1002
01:30:21,792 --> 01:30:24,002
When I left you, I was but the learner.

1003
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:26,462
Now I am the master.

1004
01:30:26,547 --> 01:30:28,548
Only a master of evil, Darth.

1005
01:30:48,861 --> 01:30:51,154
Your powers are weak, old man.

1006
01:30:51,238 --> 01:30:54,907
You can't win, Darth.
If you strike me down...

1007
01:30:54,992 --> 01:30:58,369
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

1008
01:31:05,836 --> 01:31:07,879
You should not have come back.

1009
01:31:33,614 --> 01:31:35,239
Didn't we just leave this party?

1010
01:31:37,993 --> 01:31:40,244
- What kept you?
- We ran into some old friends.

1011
01:31:40,329 --> 01:31:42,830
- The ship all right?
- Seems okay, if we can get to it.

1012
01:31:42,915 --> 01:31:45,041
I hope the old man got
the tractor beam down.

1013
01:31:59,556 --> 01:32:00,765
Look.

1014
01:32:04,478 --> 01:32:06,437
Come on, R2. We're going.

1015
01:32:08,107 --> 01:32:09,232
Now's our chance. Go!

1016
01:32:39,346 --> 01:32:40,513
Come on!

1017
01:32:41,598 --> 01:32:43,057
Come on!

1018
01:32:43,142 --> 01:32:46,269
- Luke, it's too late!
- Blast the door, kid!

1019
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:57,447
Run, Luke, run.

1020
01:33:01,368 --> 01:33:05,830
I hope that old man got the tractor beam down,
or this is gonna be a short trip. Hit it!

1021
01:33:37,404 --> 01:33:39,322
We're coming up on their sentry ships.

1022
01:33:39,406 --> 01:33:42,825
Hold them off. Angle the deflector
shields while I charge up the main guns.

1023
01:33:52,002 --> 01:33:54,003
I can't believe he's gone.

1024
01:33:57,591 --> 01:33:59,425
There wasn't anything you could have done.

1025
01:34:00,219 --> 01:34:02,512
Come on, buddy. We're not out of this yet.

1026
01:34:19,238 --> 01:34:21,614
You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp.

1027
01:34:32,459 --> 01:34:33,584
Here they come.

1028
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:53,437
They're coming in too fast!

1029
01:35:01,446 --> 01:35:05,283
- We've lost the lateral controls.
- Don't worry. She'll hold together.

1030
01:35:06,785 --> 01:35:08,828
Hear me, baby? Hold together.

1031
01:35:30,934 --> 01:35:32,518
Got him. I got him!

1032
01:35:32,603 --> 01:35:35,021
Great, kid. Don't get cocky.

1033
01:35:36,189 --> 01:35:37,982
There's still two more.

1034
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:14,393
- That's it. We did it.
- We did it.

1035
01:36:15,646 --> 01:36:18,189
Help. I think I'm melting.
This is all your fault.

1036
01:36:25,947 --> 01:36:27,615
Are they away?

1037
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:30,076
They've just made the jump
into hyperspace.

1038
01:36:30,744 --> 01:36:34,163
You're sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?

1039
01:36:35,374 --> 01:36:37,750
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.

1040
01:36:37,834 --> 01:36:39,752
This had better work.

1041
01:36:39,961 --> 01:36:42,088
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

1042
01:36:42,798 --> 01:36:45,883
You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.

1043
01:36:45,967 --> 01:36:48,302
That doesn't sound too hard.

1044
01:36:48,387 --> 01:36:52,056
They let us go. It's the only
explanation for the ease of our escape.

1045
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:54,934
- You call that easy?
- They're tracking us.

1046
01:36:55,018 --> 01:36:56,852
Not this ship, sister.

1047
01:36:58,063 --> 01:37:00,606
At least the information in R2
is still intact.

1048
01:37:00,691 --> 01:37:03,150
What's so important? What's he carrying?

1049
01:37:03,235 --> 01:37:05,444
The technical readouts
of that battle station.

1050
01:37:06,446 --> 01:37:09,740
I only hope that when the data's
analyzed a weakness can be found.

1051
01:37:09,825 --> 01:37:13,202
- It's not over yet.
- It is for me, sister.

1052
01:37:13,286 --> 01:37:16,664
I ain't in this for your revolution,
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

1053
01:37:16,748 --> 01:37:19,625
I expect to be well paid.
I'm in it for the money.

1054
01:37:19,710 --> 01:37:21,919
You needn't worry about your reward.

1055
01:37:22,003 --> 01:37:24,922
If money is all that you love,
then that's what you'll receive.

1056
01:37:28,093 --> 01:37:30,010
Your friend is quite a mercenary.

1057
01:37:30,095 --> 01:37:33,347
I wonder if he really cares
about anything... or anybody.

1058
01:37:34,433 --> 01:37:35,933
I care.

1059
01:37:42,566 --> 01:37:44,191
So...

1060
01:37:44,276 --> 01:37:46,193
what do you think of her, Han?

1061
01:37:46,278 --> 01:37:48,154
I'm trying not to, kid.

1062
01:37:48,989 --> 01:37:50,281
Good.

1063
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:56,620
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

1064
01:37:58,707 --> 01:38:01,792
What do you think?
You think a princess and a guy like me...

1065
01:38:01,877 --> 01:38:02,501
No.

1066
01:38:50,133 --> 01:38:53,344
You're safe. When we heard about
Alderaan, we feared the worst.

1067
01:38:53,428 --> 01:38:55,346
We have no time for sorrows, Commander.

1068
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:58,432
You must use the information
in this R2 unit to help plan the attack.

1069
01:38:58,517 --> 01:39:00,518
It's our only hope.

1070
01:39:21,623 --> 01:39:24,333
- Yes.
- We're approaching the planet Yavin.

1071
01:39:24,417 --> 01:39:26,752
The rebel base is on a moon
on the far side.

1072
01:39:26,837 --> 01:39:28,838
We are preparing to orbit the planet.

1073
01:39:37,848 --> 01:39:39,932
The battle station is heavily shielded...

1074
01:39:40,016 --> 01:39:43,477
and carries a firepower
greater than half the starfleet.

1075
01:39:44,187 --> 01:39:48,274
Its defenses are designed around
a direct large-scale assault.

1076
01:39:48,358 --> 01:39:53,612
A small, one-man fighter should be able
to penetrate the outer defense.

1077
01:39:55,365 --> 01:39:59,159
Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good
are snub fighters against that?

1078
01:39:59,244 --> 01:40:03,831
The Empire doesn't consider a small,
one-man fighter to be any threat...

1079
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:05,916
or they'd have a tighter defense.

1080
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:10,045
An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia...

1081
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:13,215
has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.

1082
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:16,010
The approach will not be easy.

1083
01:40:16,094 --> 01:40:19,263
You're required to maneuver
straight down this trench...

1084
01:40:19,347 --> 01:40:21,974
and skim the surface to this point.

1085
01:40:22,809 --> 01:40:25,519
The target area is only two meters wide.

1086
01:40:25,604 --> 01:40:29,273
It's a small thermal exhaust port
right below the main port.

1087
01:40:30,525 --> 01:40:33,736
The shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.

1088
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:36,572
A precise hit
will start a chain reaction...

1089
01:40:36,656 --> 01:40:38,866
which should destroy the station.

1090
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:42,494
Only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.

1091
01:40:42,579 --> 01:40:45,748
The shaft is ray-shielded,
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

1092
01:40:45,832 --> 01:40:48,000
That's impossible, even for a computer.

1093
01:40:48,084 --> 01:40:51,879
No, it's not. I used to bull's-eye
womp rats in my T-16 back home.

1094
01:40:51,963 --> 01:40:54,381
They're not much bigger than two meters.

1095
01:40:54,466 --> 01:40:57,635
Then man your ships,
and may the Force be with you.

1096
01:41:05,894 --> 01:41:08,479
Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.

1097
01:41:09,147 --> 01:41:12,858
The moon with the rebel base
will be in range in 30 minutes.

1098
01:41:12,943 --> 01:41:15,569
This will be a day long remembered.

1099
01:41:15,654 --> 01:41:17,655
It has seen the end of Kenobi...

1100
01:41:17,739 --> 01:41:20,324
and will soon see
the end of the rebellion.

1101
01:41:26,081 --> 01:41:28,499
All flight crews, man your stations.

1102
01:41:34,798 --> 01:41:37,925
So, you got your reward
and you're just leaving, then?

1103
01:41:38,009 --> 01:41:40,010
That's right. Yeah.

1104
01:41:41,096 --> 01:41:43,722
I got some old debts
I gotta pay off with this stuff.

1105
01:41:43,807 --> 01:41:47,893
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be
fool enough to stick around here, do ya?

1106
01:41:47,978 --> 01:41:51,605
Why don't you come with us?
You're pretty good in a fight. We could use ya.

1107
01:41:51,690 --> 01:41:54,692
Come on. Why don't you take a look around?

1108
01:41:54,776 --> 01:41:57,444
You know what's about to happen,
what they're up against.

1109
01:41:57,529 --> 01:42:00,322
They could use a good pilot like you.
You're turning your back on them.

1110
01:42:00,407 --> 01:42:02,825
What good's a reward
if you ain't around to use it?

1111
01:42:02,909 --> 01:42:05,869
Besides, attacking that battle station
ain't my idea of courage.

1112
01:42:05,954 --> 01:42:08,872
It's more like... suicide.

1113
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:13,502
All right.
Well, take care of yourself, Han.

1114
01:42:13,586 --> 01:42:16,255
I guess that's what you're best at,
isn't it?

1115
01:42:16,339 --> 01:42:17,715
Hey, Luke.

1116
01:42:21,011 --> 01:42:23,387
May the Force be with you.

1117
01:42:29,894 --> 01:42:33,105
What are you looking at?
I know what I'm doing.

1118
01:42:37,527 --> 01:42:39,987
All pilots to your stations.

1119
01:42:48,913 --> 01:42:51,165
- What's wrong?
- It's Han.

1120
01:42:51,249 --> 01:42:53,751
I don't know.
I really thought he'd change his mind.

1121
01:42:53,835 --> 01:42:57,379
He's got to follow his own path.
No one can choose it for him.

1122
01:42:58,381 --> 01:43:00,841
I only wish Ben were here.

1123
01:43:08,850 --> 01:43:10,851
Open main launch tubes.

1124
01:43:11,853 --> 01:43:13,771
Main launch tubes opening, sir.

1125
01:43:13,855 --> 01:43:15,522
Hey, Luke!

1126
01:43:15,607 --> 01:43:18,817
- Biggs!
- I don't believe it. How are ya?

1127
01:43:18,902 --> 01:43:20,986
- Coming up?
- I'll be up there with you.

1128
01:43:21,071 --> 01:43:23,405
- Have I got stories to tell you.
- Skywalker.

1129
01:43:25,075 --> 01:43:26,992
Are you sure you can handle this ship?

1130
01:43:27,077 --> 01:43:30,496
Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot
in the outer-rim territories.

1131
01:43:31,206 --> 01:43:33,707
- You'll do all right.
- Thank you, sir. I'll try.

1132
01:43:33,792 --> 01:43:37,711
Gotta get aboard. We'll hear all your
stories when we get back, all right?

1133
01:43:37,796 --> 01:43:40,547
Hey, Biggs.
I told you I'd make it someday.

1134
01:43:40,632 --> 01:43:43,634
It'll be like old times, Luke.
They'll never stop us.

1135
01:43:46,513 --> 01:43:49,431
This R2 unit of yours seems
a bit beat up. You want a new one?

1136
01:43:49,516 --> 01:43:52,684
Not on your life. That droid and I
have been through a lot.

1137
01:43:52,769 --> 01:43:53,811
You okay, R2?

1138
01:43:55,438 --> 01:43:56,855
Good.

1139
01:43:57,899 --> 01:44:00,651
Gold squadron, begin takeoff procedure.

1140
01:44:01,319 --> 01:44:04,321
Hang on tight, R2.
You've got to come back.

1141
01:44:06,199 --> 01:44:08,200
You wouldn't want my life
to get boring, would you?

1142
01:44:56,541 --> 01:44:59,543
Luke, the Force will be with you.

1143
01:45:11,598 --> 01:45:15,100
Standby alert. Death Star approaching.

1144
01:45:15,185 --> 01:45:18,353
Estimated time to firing range,
15 minutes.

1145
01:45:31,451 --> 01:45:33,702
- All wings report in.
- Red 10 standing by.

1146
01:45:33,786 --> 01:45:36,038
- Red Seven standing by.
- Red Three standing by.

1147
01:45:36,122 --> 01:45:38,874
- Red Six standing by.
- Red Nine standing by.

1148
01:45:38,958 --> 01:45:41,001
- Red Two standing by.
- Red 11 standing by.

1149
01:45:41,085 --> 01:45:43,045
Red Five standing by.

1150
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:46,298
Lock S-foils in attack position.

1151
01:45:50,553 --> 01:45:52,554
We're passing through the magnetic field.

1152
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:55,432
Hold tight. Switch your deflectors on.

1153
01:45:55,516 --> 01:45:56,975
Double front.

1154
01:45:59,979 --> 01:46:01,772
Look at the size of that thing.

1155
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:04,483
Cut the chatter, Red Two.
Accelerate to attack speed.

1156
01:46:07,862 --> 01:46:10,614
- This is it, boys.
- Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1157
01:46:10,698 --> 01:46:13,575
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- We're starting for the target shaft.

1158
01:46:13,660 --> 01:46:17,120
We're in position. I'm going to cut
across the axis and draw their fire.

1159
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:34,846
- Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.
- I see it. Stay low.

1160
01:46:42,272 --> 01:46:43,814
This is Red Five. I'm going in.

1161
01:46:48,361 --> 01:46:49,361
Luke, pull up!

1162
01:46:51,281 --> 01:46:53,365
- You all right?
- A little cooked, but I'm okay.

1163
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:03,250
We count 30 rebel ships, but they're so
small they're evading our turbolasers.

1164
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:05,252
We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.

1165
01:47:05,336 --> 01:47:07,462
Get the crews to their fighters.

1166
01:47:10,008 --> 01:47:13,885
Watch yourself. There's a lot of fire coming
from the right side of that deflection tower.

1167
01:47:13,970 --> 01:47:15,262
I'm on it.

1168
01:47:15,346 --> 01:47:18,807
- I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins.
- Right with you, Red Three.

1169
01:47:25,148 --> 01:47:26,940
I've got a problem here.

1170
01:47:27,025 --> 01:47:28,442
- Eject.
- I can hold it.

1171
01:47:28,526 --> 01:47:30,694
- Pull up!
- No, I'm all right...

1172
01:47:34,866 --> 01:47:37,868
The rebel base will be in firing range
in seven minutes.

1173
01:47:41,706 --> 01:47:44,374
Luke, trust your feelings.

1174
01:47:52,216 --> 01:47:53,842
Squad leaders...

1175
01:47:53,926 --> 01:47:55,969
we've picked up a new group of signals.

1176
01:47:56,054 --> 01:47:58,013
Enemy fighters coming your way.

1177
01:47:58,097 --> 01:47:59,806
My scope's negative. I don't see anything.

1178
01:47:59,891 --> 01:48:02,100
- Pick up your visual scanning.
- Here they come.

1179
01:48:05,355 --> 01:48:07,064
You've got one on your tail.

1180
01:48:12,403 --> 01:48:13,278
I'm hit!

1181
01:48:14,739 --> 01:48:17,282
- You've picked one up. Watch it.
- I can't see it.

1182
01:48:19,285 --> 01:48:21,036
He's on me tight. I can't shake him.

1183
01:48:22,705 --> 01:48:24,748
I'll be right there.

1184
01:48:36,928 --> 01:48:40,389
Several fighters have broken off
from the main group. Come with me.

1185
01:48:43,810 --> 01:48:46,937
- Fall in. Fall in.
- Watch your back, Luke.

1186
01:48:47,021 --> 01:48:49,398
Fighters above you, coming in.

1187
01:48:55,613 --> 01:48:58,365
I'm hit, but not bad.
R2, see what you can do with it.

1188
01:48:58,449 --> 01:49:00,617
Hang on back there.

1189
01:49:00,701 --> 01:49:03,370
Red Six, can you see Red Five?

1190
01:49:03,454 --> 01:49:05,872
There's a heavy fire zone.
Red Five, where are you?

1191
01:49:05,957 --> 01:49:07,416
I can't shake him.

1192
01:49:11,421 --> 01:49:12,963
I'm on him, Luke.

1193
01:49:16,175 --> 01:49:17,801
Blast it, Biggs. Where are you?

1194
01:49:24,809 --> 01:49:27,602
- Thanks, Wedge.
- Good shooting, Wedge.

1195
01:49:27,687 --> 01:49:30,814
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
We're starting our attack run.

1196
01:49:32,650 --> 01:49:35,026
I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position.

1197
01:49:37,447 --> 01:49:39,739
Stay in attack formation.

1198
01:49:39,824 --> 01:49:42,659
The exhaust port is marked and locked in.

1199
01:49:48,541 --> 01:49:51,710
Switch all power
to front deflector screen.

1200
01:49:51,794 --> 01:49:55,005
Switch all power
to front deflector screen.

1201
01:49:59,719 --> 01:50:01,470
How many guns do you think, Gold Five?

1202
01:50:01,554 --> 01:50:04,806
Say about 20 guns,
some on the surface, some on the towers.

1203
01:50:04,891 --> 01:50:07,726
Death Star will be in range
in five minutes.

1204
01:50:09,854 --> 01:50:12,898
Switch to targeting computer.

1205
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:17,360
Computer's locked. Getting a signal.

1206
01:50:19,697 --> 01:50:21,865
The guns. They've stopped.

1207
01:50:23,576 --> 01:50:26,119
Stabilize your rear deflectors.
Watch for enemy fighters.

1208
01:50:26,204 --> 01:50:28,705
They're coming in. Three marks at 210.

1209
01:50:30,666 --> 01:50:32,834
I'll take them myself. Cover me.

1210
01:50:32,919 --> 01:50:34,211
Yes, sir.

1211
01:50:48,726 --> 01:50:51,186
- It's no good. I can't maneuver.
- Stay on target.

1212
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:53,188
- We're too close.
- Stay on target.

1213
01:50:54,941 --> 01:50:55,899
Loosen up!

1214
01:50:58,903 --> 01:51:01,780
Gold Five to Red Leader,
lost Tiree, lost Hutch.

1215
01:51:01,864 --> 01:51:04,241
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- They came from behind.

1216
01:51:10,581 --> 01:51:13,208
We've analyzed their attack, sir,
and there is a danger.

1217
01:51:13,292 --> 01:51:15,210
Should I have your ship standing by?

1218
01:51:15,294 --> 01:51:18,171
Evacuate? In our moment of triumph?

1219
01:51:18,256 --> 01:51:20,757
I think you overestimate their chances.

1220
01:51:21,425 --> 01:51:23,468
Rebel base, three minutes and closing.

1221
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:26,096
Red boys, this is Red Leader.

1222
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:27,889
Rendezvous at mark 6. 1.

1223
01:51:27,974 --> 01:51:31,518
- This is Red Two flying toward you.
- Red Three standing by.

1224
01:51:31,602 --> 01:51:33,562
Red Leader, this is Base One.

1225
01:51:33,646 --> 01:51:36,314
Keep half your group out of range
for the next run.

1226
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:39,025
Copy, Base One.
Luke, take Red Two and Three.

1227
01:51:39,110 --> 01:51:42,445
Hold up here and wait for
my signal to start your run.

1228
01:51:50,913 --> 01:51:52,122
This is it.

1229
01:51:56,669 --> 01:51:58,795
We should be able to see it by now.

1230
01:52:00,464 --> 01:52:02,257
Keep your eyes open for those fighters.

1231
01:52:04,010 --> 01:52:06,428
There's too much interference.
Red Five, can you see them?

1232
01:52:06,512 --> 01:52:09,514
- No sign of any... Wait. Coming in .35.
- I see them.

1233
01:52:11,058 --> 01:52:12,142
I'm in range.

1234
01:52:13,436 --> 01:52:15,145
Target's coming up.

1235
01:52:17,732 --> 01:52:19,858
Just hold them off for a few seconds.

1236
01:52:20,693 --> 01:52:22,319
Close up formation.

1237
01:52:23,654 --> 01:52:25,822
Almost there.

1238
01:52:34,915 --> 01:52:38,168
- Let her loose. They're right behind me.
- Almost there.

1239
01:52:39,545 --> 01:52:41,212
I can't hold them.

1240
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:50,180
It's away!

1241
01:52:54,685 --> 01:52:56,311
- It's a hit!
- Negative.

1242
01:52:56,395 --> 01:52:58,480
Negative. It didn't go in.

1243
01:52:58,564 --> 01:53:01,232
It just impacted on the surface.

1244
01:53:07,698 --> 01:53:09,366
Red Leader, we're right above you.

1245
01:53:09,450 --> 01:53:11,618
Turn to .05. We'll cover for you.

1246
01:53:11,702 --> 01:53:14,663
Stay there. I just lost
my starboard engine.

1247
01:53:15,456 --> 01:53:17,707
Get set up for your attack run.

1248
01:53:31,055 --> 01:53:33,682
Rebel base, one minute and closing.

1249
01:53:34,392 --> 01:53:35,975
Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.

1250
01:53:36,060 --> 01:53:39,437
We're going in full throttle. That ought
to keep those fighters off our back.

1251
01:53:39,522 --> 01:53:41,648
Right with you, boss.

1252
01:53:41,732 --> 01:53:44,025
At that speed,
will you be able to pull out in time?

1253
01:53:44,110 --> 01:53:46,111
It'll be just like
Beggars Canyon back home.

1254
01:53:53,452 --> 01:53:55,704
We'll stay back far enough to cover you.

1255
01:53:55,788 --> 01:53:58,373
My scope shows the tower,
but l can't see the exhaust port.

1256
01:53:58,457 --> 01:53:59,916
Are you sure the computer can hit it?

1257
01:54:03,421 --> 01:54:05,422
Watch yourself.
Increase speed, full throttle.

1258
01:54:05,506 --> 01:54:06,798
What about that tower?

1259
01:54:06,882 --> 01:54:09,300
You worry about those fighters.
I'll worry about the tower.

1260
01:54:15,725 --> 01:54:19,310
R2, that stabilizer's broken loose
again. See if you can't lock it down.

1261
01:54:28,487 --> 01:54:30,280
Fighters coming in .3.

1262
01:54:39,206 --> 01:54:41,708
- I'm hit. I can't stay with you.
- Get clear, Wedge.

1263
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:44,294
- You can't do any more good back there.
- Sorry.

1264
01:54:45,337 --> 01:54:47,297
Let him go. Stay on the leader.

1265
01:54:50,259 --> 01:54:52,469
Hurry, Luke.
They're coming in much faster this time.

1266
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:59,350
R2, try and increase the power.

1267
01:55:04,732 --> 01:55:05,982
Hurry up, Luke. Quick.

1268
01:55:06,901 --> 01:55:08,026
Quick.

1269
01:55:15,075 --> 01:55:17,619
Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.

1270
01:55:17,703 --> 01:55:18,828
I'm on the leader.

1271
01:55:22,291 --> 01:55:23,792
Hang on, R2.

1272
01:55:39,183 --> 01:55:41,768
Use the Force, Luke.

1273
01:55:44,396 --> 01:55:47,023
Let go, Luke.

1274
01:55:48,484 --> 01:55:50,860
The Force is strong with this one.

1275
01:55:50,945 --> 01:55:52,904
Luke, trust me.

1276
01:55:58,077 --> 01:55:59,911
His computer's off.

1277
01:55:59,995 --> 01:56:02,121
You switched off your
targeting computer. What's wrong?

1278
01:56:02,206 --> 01:56:04,874
Nothing. I'm all right.

1279
01:56:17,805 --> 01:56:19,055
I've lost R2.

1280
01:56:20,891 --> 01:56:23,017
The Death Star has cleared the planet.

1281
01:56:23,102 --> 01:56:25,436
The Death Star has cleared the planet.

1282
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:28,106
Rebel base in range.

1283
01:56:28,190 --> 01:56:30,108
You may fire when ready.

1284
01:56:30,818 --> 01:56:32,277
Commence primary ignition.

1285
01:56:46,250 --> 01:56:47,709
I have you now.

1286
01:56:50,129 --> 01:56:51,296
What?

1287
01:56:53,924 --> 01:56:54,757
Look out.

1288
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:04,434
You're all clear, kid.
Now let's blow this thing and go home.

1289
01:57:11,275 --> 01:57:12,609
Stand by.

1290
01:57:15,613 --> 01:57:17,322
Stand by.

1291
01:57:27,791 --> 01:57:29,751
Great shot, kid!
That was one in a million!

1292
01:57:31,128 --> 01:57:35,632
Remember, the Force
will be with you always.

1293
01:58:00,991 --> 01:58:02,867
I just knew you'd come back.

1294
01:58:02,952 --> 01:58:05,495
I wasn't gonna let you get all
the credit and take all the reward.

1295
01:58:05,579 --> 01:58:07,538
I knew there was more to you than money.

1296
01:58:08,207 --> 01:58:09,499
Oh, no.

1297
01:58:09,583 --> 01:58:12,043
Oh, my. R2, can you hear me?

1298
01:58:12,711 --> 01:58:15,588
Say something.
You can repair him, can't you?

1299
01:58:15,673 --> 01:58:18,925
- We'll get to work on him right away.
- You must repair him.

1300
01:58:19,009 --> 01:58:21,928
Sir, if any of my circuits or gears
will help, I'll gladly donate them.

1301
01:58:22,012 --> 01:58:24,013
He'll be all right.

1302
02:04:40,724 --> 02:04:41,724
English - US


1
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:35,507
Echo Three to Echo Seven.

2
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,634
Han, old buddy, do you read me?

3
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,803
Loud and clear, kid. What's up?

4
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,597
I finished my circle.
I don't pick up any life readings.

5
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:45,642
There isn't enough life on this ice cube
to fill a space cruiser.

6
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,560
The sensors are placed. I'm going back.

7
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:49,562
Right. I'll see you shortly.

8
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:51,773
There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here.

9
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,109
I want to check it out. It won't take long.

10
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:55,318
Steady.

11
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:59,989
Steady, girl. What's the matter?
You smell something?

12
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,949
Chewie. Chewie?

13
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:51,166
All right. Don't lose your temper.

14
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,710
I'll come right back and give you a hand.

15
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,356
Solo.

16
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:18,234
No sign of life out there, General.
The sensors are in place.

17
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,154
- You'll know if anything comes around.
- Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

18
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:24,073
No. He's checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.

19
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:27,702
With all the meteor activity, it's gonna
be difficult to spot approaching ships.

20
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,746
General, I gotta leave. I can't stay anymore.

21
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,624
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- There's a price on my head.

22
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,168
If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt,
I'm a dead man.

23
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,128
A death mark's not an easy thing to live with.

24
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:41,216
You're a good fighter, Solo.
I hate to lose you.

25
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,759
Thank you, General.

26
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,894
Well, Your Highness, guess this is it.

27
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:54,896
That's right.

28
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,109
Don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess.

29
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:04,322
Han.

30
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,202
- Yes, Your Highnessness.
- I thought you had decided to stay.

31
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,163
The bounty hunter we ran into
in Ord Mantell changed my mind.

32
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:14,540
Han, we need you.

33
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,751
- We need?
- Yes.

34
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,337
- What about you need?
- I need?

35
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,923
I don't know what you're talking about.

36
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:25,551
- You probably don't.
- What precisely am I supposed to know?

37
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:29,138
Come on. You want me to stay because
of the way you feel about me.

38
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,849
Yes. You're a great help to us.
You're a natural leader.

39
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,519
No. That's not it.

40
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,271
Come on.

41
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,565
- Come on.
- You're imagining things.

42
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,609
Am I? Then why are you following me?

43
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:43,945
Afraid I'd leave
without giving you a good-bye kiss?

44
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,656
- I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
- I can arrange that.

45
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,908
You could use a good kiss!

46
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,662
Don't blame me. I didn't ask you
to turn on the thermal heater.

47
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,207
I merely commented that it was freezing
in the princess's chamber.

48
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:58,167
It's supposed to be freezing.

49
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,712
How we're going to dry
her clothes I really don't know.

50
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,046
Oh, switch off!

51
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:05,258
Why did you take this apart now?
I'm trying to get us out of here.

52
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,510
- Excuse me.
- Put them back together right now.

53
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,679
- Might I have a word?
- What do you want?

54
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,307
Princess Leia's been trying
to get you on the communicator.

55
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,600
I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.

56
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:17,603
Princess Leia is wondering about
Master Luke. He hasn't come back.

57
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,981
- She doesn't know where he is.
- I don't know where he is.

58
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,900
- Nobody knows where he is.
- What do you mean, nobody knows?

59
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,319
Deck Officer.

60
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,946
- Deck Officer.
- Excuse me, sir. Might I...

61
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:28,823
Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?

62
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,617
I haven't seen him. It's possible
he came in the south entrance.

63
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,953
It's possible? Why don't you go find out?

64
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:36,622
- It's getting dark out there.
- Yes, sir.

65
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,125
Excuse me, sir.
Might I inquire what's going on?

66
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,544
- Why not?
- Impossible man.

67
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,671
Come along, R2. Let's find Princess Leia.

68
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:46,883
Between ourselves, I think
Master Luke is in considerable danger.

69
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,644
Commander Skywalker
hasn't come in the south entrance.

70
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:01,230
- Maybe he forgot to check in.
- Not likely. Are the speeders ready?

71
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,441
Not yet. We're having trouble
adapting them to the cold.

72
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,527
- We'll have to go out on tauntauns.
- The temperature's dropping too rapidly.

73
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:08,696
That's right, and my friend's out in it.

74
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,953
Your tauntaun will freeze
before you reach the first marker.

75
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,122
Then I'll see you in hell.

76
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:37,845
You must come along now, R2.

77
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,014
There's really nothing more we can do.

78
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,225
And my joints are freezing up.

79
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:47,230
Don't say things like that.
Of course we'll see Master Luke again.

80
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,107
And he'll be quite all right. You'll see.

81
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:53,903
Stupid little short circuit.
He'll be quite all right.

82
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,297
Sir, all the patrols are in. Still no...

83
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:58,384
Still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.

84
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:02,597
Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals...

85
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:06,100
although he admits that his own range
is far too weak to abandon all hope.

86
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,352
Your Highness,
there's nothing more we can do tonight.

87
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,813
The shield doors must be closed.

88
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,567
- Close the doors.
- Yes, sir.

89
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:20,823
R2 says the chances of survival are 725-to-1.

90
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:36,130
Actually, R2 has been known
to make mistakes...

91
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,843
from time to time.

92
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,803
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

93
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:48,392
Don't worry about Master Luke.
I'm sure he'll be all right.

94
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:51,354
He's quite clever, you know,
for a human being.

95
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,163
Luke.

96
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,333
Luke.

97
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,342
Ben?

98
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,095
You will go to the Dagobah system.

99
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,971
Dagobah system?

100
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:29,558
There you will learn from Yoda...

101
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:33,437
the Jedi master who instructed me.

102
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:55,292
Don't do this, Luke. Give me a sign here.

103
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:21,318
- Not much time.
- Ben.

104
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:28,993
Hang on, kid.

105
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,330
Dagobah system. Dagobah.

106
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,124
This may smell bad, kid...

107
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:38,419
Yoda.

108
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:43,007
but it'll keep you warm
till I get the shelter up.

109
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,176
Ben. Dagobah.

110
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,098
I thought they smelled bad...

111
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:53,100
on the outside.

112
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,813
Echo Base, I've got something.

113
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:40,856
Not much, but it could be a life-form.

114
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,738
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?

115
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:49,740
This is Rogue Two.

116
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:52,535
This is Rogue Two.

117
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,538
Captain Solo, do you copy?

118
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,672
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?

119
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,632
This is Rogue Two.

120
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,885
Good morning. Nice of you guys to drop by.

121
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,848
Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.

122
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,559
I've found them. Repeat. I've found them.

123
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,009
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

124
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:53,345
- Thanks, 3PO.
- R2 expresses his relief also.

125
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,974
How ya feelin', kid?
You don't look so bad to me.

126
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,977
You look strong enough
to pull the ears off a gundark.

127
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:03,898
- Thanks to you.
- That's two you owe me, junior.

128
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,357
Well, Your Worship...

129
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:08,569
looks like you managed to keep me around
for a little while longer.

130
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,571
I had nothing to do with it.

131
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,324
General Rieekan thinks
it's dangerous for any ships to leave...

132
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,367
until we've activated the energy field.

133
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:16,744
That's a good story.

134
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:20,789
I think you just can't bear to let a
gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.

135
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:24,251
I don't know where
you get your delusions, laser brain.

136
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,882
Laugh it up, fuzzball...

137
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:33,093
but you didn't see us alone
in the south passage.

138
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,471
She expressed her true feelings for me.

139
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,722
My...

140
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:40,267
Why, you stuck-up, half-witted...

141
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:42,478
scruffy-looking nerf herder!

142
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,648
Who's scruffy-lookin'?

143
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:52,363
I must have hit close to the mark
to get her riled up like that, huh, kid?

144
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,953
I guess you don't know
everything about women yet.

145
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,878
Headquarters personnel,
report to command center.

146
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,759
Headquarters personnel,
report to command center.

147
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,844
Take it easy.

148
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,013
Excuse us, please.

149
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,351
Princess, we have a visitor.

150
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:26,397
We picked up something
outside Zone 12 moving east.

151
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,774
- It's metal.
- It couldn't be one of those creatures.

152
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,695
- Could be one of our speeders.
- No. Wait.

153
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,489
There's something very weak coming through.

154
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,829
Sir, I am fluent in six million
forms of communication.

155
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:45,082
This signal is not used by the Alliance.
It could be an imperial code.

156
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,132
It isn't friendly. Chewie, let's check it out.

157
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:56,260
Send Rogues 10 and 11 to Station 38.

158
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:34,506
- I'm afraid there's not much left.
- What was it?

159
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,675
Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard.

160
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,262
- Must have had a self-destruct.
- An imperial probe droid.

161
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,265
It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.

162
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,267
We'd better start the evacuation.

163
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,107
- Admiral.
- Yes, Captain?

164
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:37,402
I think we've got something, sir.
The report is only a fragment...

165
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:40,405
from a probe droid in the Hoth system,
but it's the best lead we've had.

166
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,617
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.

167
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,703
- I want proof, not leads.
- The visuals indicate life readings.

168
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:49,081
It could mean anything.
If we followed up every lead...

169
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:52,251
But, sir, the Hoth system is
supposed to be devoid of human forms.

170
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,795
- You found something?
- Yes, my lord.

171
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,508
That's it. The rebels are there.

172
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:04,096
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

173
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,974
- It could be smugglers...
- That is the system.

174
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,476
And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.

175
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:12,604
Set your course for the Hoth system.

176
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:15,149
General Veers, prepare your men.

177
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,608
Admiral.

178
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,492
Groups Seven and 10
will stay behind to fly the speeders.

179
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:27,452
As soon as each transport is loaded...

180
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:29,621
evacuation control
will give clearance for launch.

181
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,415
Right, sir.

182
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:35,627
All right. That's it.

183
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,212
Try it.

184
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,717
Turn it off! Turn it off!

185
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:47,472
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-47s.

186
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:51,226
Forget the heavy equipment. There's time
to get small modules on the transports.

187
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,395
- Take care, sir.
- Thanks.

188
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,943
Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?

189
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,324
Okay, okay.

190
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,243
Hi, kid.

191
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:11,455
There's gotta be a reason for it.
Check it at the other end.

192
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:12,998
Wait a second.

193
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,501
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

194
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,885
Be careful.

195
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,887
You too.

196
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:34,853
General, there's a fleet of Stardestroyers...

197
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,231
coming out of hyperspace in Sector Four.

198
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:40,317
Reroute all power to the energy shield.

199
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:43,528
We gotta hold them till
all transports are away.

200
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:45,697
Prepare for ground assault.

201
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:02,923
- What is it, General?
- The fleet has moved out of light speed.

202
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:05,133
ComScan has detected an energy field...

203
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:07,844
protecting an area of the sixth planet
of the Hoth system.

204
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:10,430
The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

205
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:13,016
The rebels are alerted to our presence.

206
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:16,228
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.

207
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,605
He felt surprise was wiser.

208
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,816
He is as clumsy as he is stupid.

209
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,528
General, prepare your troops
for a surface attack.

210
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,280
Yes, my lord.

211
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:34,371
Lord Vader.

212
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:37,499
The fleet has moved out of light speed,
and we're preparing to...

213
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:42,713
You have failed me for the last time, Admiral.

214
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:45,215
- Captain Piett.
- Yes, my lord?

215
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,343
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field...

216
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:51,430
and deploy the fleet so that
nothing gets off the system.

217
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:54,725
You are in command now, Admiral Piett.

218
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,685
Thank you, Lord Vader.

219
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:01,356
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.

220
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:04,151
The heavy transport ships
will leave as soon as they're loaded.

221
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,320
Only two fighter escorts per ship.

222
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:09,531
The energy shield
can only be opened for a short time...

223
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,159
so you'll have to stay very close
to your transports.

224
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:14,369
Two fighters against a Stardestroyer?

225
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,538
The ion cannon will fire several shots...

226
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,791
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

227
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:22,002
When you've gotten past the energy shield...

228
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,171
proceed directly to the rendezvous point.

229
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:26,214
Understood?

230
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,924
Good luck.

231
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:30,552
Everybody to your stations. Let's go.

232
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:50,739
Their primary target will be
the power generators.

233
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,741
Prepare to open shield.

234
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,707
Sir, rebel ships are coming into our sector.

235
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:02,918
Good. Our first catch of the day.

236
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:07,005
Stand by, ion control.

237
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,091
Fire.

238
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,401
The first transport is away.

239
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:30,278
The first transport is away.

240
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:38,662
Feeling all right, sir?

241
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,664
Just like new, Dak. How about you?

242
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,708
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

243
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:45,919
I know what you mean.

244
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:07,524
Echo Station 3-T8.
We've spotted imperial walkers.

245
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:10,110
Imperial walkers on the north ridge.

246
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:34,509
Echo Station 57, we're on our way.

247
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:41,933
All right, boys, keep tight now.

248
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:44,186
Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set.

249
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,770
Steady, Dak.

250
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,731
Attack pattern Delta. Go now.

251
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,195
I'm coming in.

252
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:58,742
Hobbie, you still with me?

253
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:23,600
That armor's too strong for blasters.

254
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,230
Rogue Group, use your harpoons and tow cables.

255
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:30,565
Go for the legs. It might be our only chance.

256
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,152
Stand by, Dak.

257
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:37,072
Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control.

258
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,199
I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.

259
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:41,201
Just hang on.

260
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:44,120
Hang on, Dak.
Get ready to fire that tow cable.

261
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:50,544
Dak?

262
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,571
Yes, Lord Vader.
I've reached the main power generators.

263
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:20,782
The shield will be down in moments.
You may start your landing.

264
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:26,955
Rogue Three.

265
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,498
Copy, Rogue Leader.

266
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:31,585
Wedge, I've lost my gunner.
You'll have to make this shot.

267
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:33,420
I'll cover for you.

268
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:35,922
Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass.

269
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:39,092
Coming around, Rogue Leader.

270
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,430
Steady, Rogue Two.

271
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:45,473
Activate harpoon.

272
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:49,978
Good shot, Jansen.

273
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:58,320
One more pass.

274
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:06,119
Cable out. Let her go!

275
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:07,495
Detach cable.

276
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:09,331
Cable detached.

277
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:18,840
Come on!

278
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:29,267
- That got him!
- I see it, Wedge. Good work.

279
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:31,853
I don't think we can protect
two transports at a time.

280
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,272
It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer.

281
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:36,024
We have no choice.

282
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,694
- Launch patrol.
- Evacuate remaining ground staff.

283
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:48,078
This one goes there,
that one goes there. Right?

284
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:51,665
R2, you take good care
of Master Luke now, understand?

285
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,669
And do take good care of yourself.

286
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,882
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

287
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,991
All troops will debark for ground assault.

288
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:29,577
Prepare to target the main generator.

289
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:36,710
- Rogue Two, are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader.

290
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:38,712
Set harpoon. I'll cover for you.

291
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:43,216
- Coming around.
- Watch that cross fire, boys.

292
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,428
Set for position three.

293
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:47,846
Steady.

294
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,473
Stay tight and low. This is it!

295
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,605
Hobbie!

296
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,232
I've been hit!

297
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:44,611
- You all right?
- Why are you still here?

298
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:47,739
- Heard the command center had been hit.
- You've got your clearance to leave.

299
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:51,284
Don't worry. I'll leave.
First I'm gonna get you to your ship.

300
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:54,496
Your Highness, we must take
this last transport. It's our only hope.

301
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,707
Send all troops in Sector 12 to
the south slope to protect the fighters.

302
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:01,419
Imperial troops have entered the base.

303
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:03,171
Imperial troops have entered...

304
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,173
Come on. That's it.

305
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,675
Give the evacuation code signal.

306
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:11,596
And get to your transports.

307
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,847
Wait for me.

308
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,432
Begin retreat!

309
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:17,352
Fall back!

310
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:18,413
- Distance to power generators?
- 17.28.

311
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:29,424
Target. Maximum firepower.

312
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:58,369
Transport, this is Solo.
Take off. I can't get to you.

313
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:00,455
I'll get her out on the Falcon. Come on.

314
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,126
Where are you going? Come back!

315
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:26,981
Wait! Wait for me! Stop!

316
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:28,983
- How typical.
- Come on.

317
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:35,698
Hurry up, goldenrod!
You're gonna be a permanent resident.

318
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:37,659
Wait! Wait!

319
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:58,763
- How's this?
- Would it help if I got out and pushed?

320
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:01,099
- Captain Solo. Captain Solo.
- It might.

321
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:05,061
Sir, might I suggest that you...

322
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,854
It can wait.

323
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:13,611
This bucket of bolts
will never get past that blockade.

324
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:15,822
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.

325
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:26,749
Come on! Come on!

326
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:29,877
Switch over.
Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

327
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,547
See?

328
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,008
Someday you'll be wrong.
I hope I'm there to see it.

329
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,012
Punch it!

330
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:58,072
R2.

331
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,784
Get her ready for takeoff.

332
00:36:04,038 --> 00:36:06,247
Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous.

333
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:12,170
Don't worry, R2. We're going. We're going.

334
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:27,935
There's nothing wrong, R2.
I'm just setting a new course.

335
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:35,568
We're not gonna regroup with the others.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

336
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,405
Yes, R2.

337
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:45,286
That's all right. I'd like to keep it
on manual control for a while.

338
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:04,347
- I saw 'em! I saw 'em!
- Saw what?

339
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,641
Stardestroyers, two of 'em coming right at us.

340
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,602
- Sir, might I suggest...
- Shut him up or shut him down!

341
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:13,397
Check the deflector shield.

342
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:17,485
Great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them.

343
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:23,783
Take evasive action!

344
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:38,172
- Prepare to jump to light speed.
- But, sir!

345
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:40,842
They're getting closer.

346
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:43,136
Oh, yeah? Watch this.

347
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,807
Watch what?

348
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:51,894
- I think we're in trouble.
- If I may say so...

349
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:54,480
I noticed earlier the hyperdrive
motivator has been damaged.

350
00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:57,692
- It's impossible to go to light speed.
- We're in trouble.

351
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,239
Horizontal boosters!

352
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,493
Alluvial dampers.

353
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:12,957
That's not it. Bring me the hydrospanner.

354
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,130
I don't know how
we're gonna get out of this one.

355
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,050
Chewie!

356
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,764
That wasn't a laser blast. Something hit us.

357
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:30,349
Han, get up here.

358
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:33,477
Come on, Chewie!

359
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:35,354
Asteroids.

360
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,903
- Chewie, set 271.
- What are you doing?

361
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:45,573
You're not actually going
into an asteroid field?

362
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,450
They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?

363
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:52,580
You don't have to do this to impress me.

364
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,875
Sir, the possibility of successfully
navigating an asteroid field...

365
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:59,253
- is approximately 3,720-to-1.
- Never tell me the odds.

366
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:30,368
You said you wanted to be around when
I made a mistake. This could be it.

367
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:32,119
I take it back.

368
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:35,331
We're gonna get pulverized
if we stay out here much longer.

369
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,250
- Ain't gonna argue with that.
- Pulverized?

370
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:39,210
I'm going closer to one of the big ones.

371
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,170
- Closer?
- Closer?

372
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,157
This is suicide! There's nowhere to go.

373
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:12,243
There. That looks pretty good.

374
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,245
What looks pretty good?

375
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,747
Yeah. That'll do nicely.

376
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:19,709
Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?

377
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:31,887
I hope you know what you're doing.

378
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:33,472
Yeah. Me too.

379
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:44,525
Yep, that's it. Dagobah.

380
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:49,196
No, I'm not gonna change my mind about this.

381
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:52,575
I'm not picking up any cities or technology.

382
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,744
Massive life-form readings though.

383
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,872
There's something alive down there.

384
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:02,418
Yes. I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.

385
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:11,844
I know! I know!

386
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:14,638
All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing.

387
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:17,850
Just hang on.
I'm gonna start the landing cycle.

388
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:14,615
No, R2, you stay put. I'll have a look around.

389
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,287
R2?

390
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:25,418
Where are you?

391
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,339
R2!

392
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,806
You be more careful.

393
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:44,645
R2, that way.

394
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,008
R2!

395
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,162
Oh, no.

396
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:46,457
Are you all right? Come on.

397
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,046
You were lucky to get out of there.

398
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:55,090
Anything broken?

399
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:00,930
If you're saying coming here was a bad idea...

400
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:03,224
I'm beginning to agree with ya.

401
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:06,018
R2, what are we doing here?

402
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:07,561
It's like...

403
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:10,689
something out of a dream or...

404
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:13,692
I don't know.

405
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:15,861
Maybe I'm just going crazy.

406
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,603
Yes, Admiral?

407
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:51,814
Our ships have sighted
the Millennium Falcon, lord...

408
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:55,025
but it has entered an asteroid field,
and we cannot risk...

409
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,945
Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral.

410
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:01,615
- I want that ship, not excuses.
- Yes, lord.

411
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:10,833
I'm gonna shut down everything
but the emergency power systems.

412
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:14,920
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does
that include shutting me down too?

413
00:45:15,005 --> 00:45:17,089
No. I need you to talk to the Falcon...

414
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:19,466
find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.

415
00:45:27,267 --> 00:45:30,811
Sir, it's quite possible
this asteroid is not entirely stable.

416
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,813
Not entirely stable?

417
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:34,982
I'm glad you're here to tell us these things.

418
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:38,694
Chewie, take the professor in the back
and plug him into the hyperdrive.

419
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:41,322
Sometimes I just don't
understand human behavior.

420
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:43,782
After all, I'm only trying to do my job.

421
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,289
Let go.

422
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,418
- Let go, please.
- Don't get excited.

423
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:58,255
Captain, being held by you
isn't quite enough to get me excited.

424
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,215
Sorry, sweetheart.

425
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,010
I haven't got time for anything else.

426
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,881
Ready for some power? Okay.

427
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,303
Let's see now.

428
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:48,722
Put that in there. There you go.

429
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,603
Now all I gotta do is find this Yoda...

430
00:46:54,688 --> 00:46:57,064
if he even exists.

431
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:05,447
It's really a strange place
to find a Jedi master.

432
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:08,742
This place gives me the creeps.

433
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:14,081
Still...

434
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,418
there's something familiar about this place.

435
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:21,422
I don't know.

436
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:23,590
- I feel like...
- Feel like what?

437
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:26,301
Like we're being watched.

438
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:29,430
Away put your weapon. I mean you no harm.

439
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,392
I am wondering, why are you here?

440
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:38,063
- I'm looking for someone.
- Looking?

441
00:47:38,148 --> 00:47:40,816
Found someone you have, I would say.

442
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:43,610
Right.

443
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:46,947
Help you I can. Yes.

444
00:47:47,741 --> 00:47:48,991
I don't think so.

445
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:53,328
I'm looking for a great warrior.

446
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:55,080
Great warrior.

447
00:47:58,126 --> 00:48:00,419
Wars not make one great.

448
00:48:08,762 --> 00:48:10,512
Put that down.

449
00:48:10,597 --> 00:48:12,598
Hey! That's my dinner.

450
00:48:15,852 --> 00:48:18,604
How you get so big eating food of this kind?

451
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:20,939
Listen, friend, we didn't mean
to land in that puddle.

452
00:48:21,024 --> 00:48:23,609
If we could get our ship out, we would.
But we can't.

453
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:25,819
Aw, cannot get your ship out.

454
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:27,613
Get out of there.

455
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:33,160
Hey, you could have broken this.

456
00:48:34,746 --> 00:48:36,830
Don't do that.

457
00:48:45,882 --> 00:48:47,966
You're making a mess.

458
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:51,512
Hey, give me that.

459
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:54,181
Mine, or I will help you not.

460
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,308
I don't want your help. I want my lamp back.

461
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:58,644
I'm gonna need it to get out of
this slimy mudhole.

462
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:01,480
Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is.

463
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:06,735
R2, let him have it.

464
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:12,157
- Mine! Mine! Mine!
- R2.

465
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:19,456
Will you move along, little fella?
We got a lot of work to do.

466
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,752
Stay and help you I will. Find your friend.

467
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:27,548
I'm not looking for a friend.
I'm looking for a Jedi master.

468
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:32,010
Jedi master. Yoda.

469
00:49:32,095 --> 00:49:34,721
- You seek Yoda.
- You know him?

470
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,559
Take you to him I will.

471
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:42,938
Yes, yes, but now we must eat.

472
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:45,732
Come. Good food. Come.

473
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:57,160
Come, come.

474
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:00,455
R2...

475
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:03,584
stay and watch after the camp.

476
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:19,182
Where is R2 when I need him?

477
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:21,977
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate...

478
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:24,021
but it has the most peculiar dialect.

479
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:27,649
I believe it says the power coupling
on the negative axis has been polarized.

480
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:30,235
I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.

481
00:50:31,279 --> 00:50:33,614
Well, of course I'll have to replace it.

482
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:37,075
Here. And, Chewie...

483
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:41,413
I think we better replace
the negative power coupling.

484
00:51:03,645 --> 00:51:06,438
Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.

485
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:09,024
Would you please stop calling me that?

486
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:11,109
Sure, Leia.

487
00:51:11,194 --> 00:51:14,655
- You make it so difficult sometimes.
- I do. I really do.

488
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:17,991
You could be a little nicer though.

489
00:51:18,076 --> 00:51:20,786
Admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right.

490
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:25,415
Occasionally, maybe...

491
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,001
when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.

492
00:51:28,086 --> 00:51:29,544
Scoundrel?

493
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:35,217
I like the sound of that.

494
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,096
- Stop that.
- Stop what?

495
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,390
Stop that. My hands are dirty.

496
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:43,684
My hands are dirty too.
What are you afraid of?

497
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:45,978
- Afraid?
- You're trembling.

498
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,981
I'm not trembling.

499
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,901
You like me because I'm a scoundrel.

500
00:51:52,986 --> 00:51:55,445
There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.

501
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,614
I happen to like nice men.

502
00:51:57,699 --> 00:52:00,409
- I'm a nice man.
- No, you're not.

503
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:04,329
Sir, sir!

504
00:52:04,414 --> 00:52:07,332
I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.

505
00:52:09,544 --> 00:52:10,794
Thank you.

506
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:13,880
- Thank you very much.
- You're perfectly welcome, sir.

507
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:23,098
That, Lord Vader, was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes.

508
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:26,143
Considering the damage we've sustained,
they must have been destroyed.

509
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:29,563
No, Captain, they're alive.

510
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:34,067
I want every ship available to sweep
the asteroid field until they are found.

511
00:52:38,531 --> 00:52:41,867
- Lord Vader.
- Yes, Admiral. What is it?

512
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:44,244
The emperor commands you
to make contact with him.

513
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:46,538
Move the ship out of the asteroid field...

514
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:48,915
so that we can send a clear transmission.

515
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,667
Yes, my lord.

516
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:09,811
What is thy bidding, my master?

517
00:53:11,064 --> 00:53:15,150
There is a great disturbance in the Force.

518
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:18,361
I have felt it.

519
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:21,031
We have a new enemy...

520
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:25,160
the young rebel who destroyed the Death Star.

521
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:28,413
I have no doubt this boy...

522
00:53:28,498 --> 00:53:32,918
is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.

523
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:35,295
How is that possible?

524
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:38,799
Search your feelings, Lord Vader.

525
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:42,135
You will know it to be true.

526
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:44,721
He could destroy us.

527
00:53:44,806 --> 00:53:46,932
He's just a boy.

528
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:49,518
Obi-Wan can no longer help him.

529
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:53,230
The Force is strong with him.

530
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:59,528
The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.

531
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:01,822
If he could be turned...

532
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:04,825
he would become a powerful ally.

533
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:07,536
Yes.

534
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:12,666
He would be a great asset.

535
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,043
Can it be done?

536
00:54:15,128 --> 00:54:19,131
He will join us or die, master.

537
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:39,693
I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't
understand why we can't see Yoda now.

538
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:43,613
Patience. For the Jedi,
it is time to eat as well.

539
00:54:46,993 --> 00:54:48,994
Eat. Eat.

540
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:51,204
Hot.

541
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:00,922
Good food. Good.

542
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:03,967
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

543
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:06,344
Not far. Yoda not far.

544
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:09,222
Patience. Soon you will be with him.

545
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:14,311
Root leaf. I cook.

546
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:18,607
Why wish you become Jedi?

547
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,360
Mostly 'cause of my father, I guess.

548
00:55:22,445 --> 00:55:25,572
Father. Powerful Jedi was he.

549
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:28,867
- Powerful Jedi.
- Oh, come on.

550
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,454
How could you know my father?
You don't even know who I am.

551
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:36,082
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
We're wasting our time!

552
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,794
I cannot teach him.

553
00:55:39,879 --> 00:55:41,963
The boy has no patience.

554
00:55:42,048 --> 00:55:44,341
He will learn patience.

555
00:55:49,138 --> 00:55:51,556
Much anger in him...

556
00:55:51,641 --> 00:55:53,516
like his father.

557
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:57,395
Was I any different when you taught me?

558
00:55:58,689 --> 00:55:59,689
No.

559
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:03,902
- He is not ready.
- Yoda.

560
00:56:06,948 --> 00:56:08,823
I am ready.

561
00:56:08,908 --> 00:56:11,868
I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm...

562
00:56:11,953 --> 00:56:15,830
Ready, are you? What know you ready?

563
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:19,918
For 800 years have I trained Jedi.

564
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:23,797
My own counsel will I keep
on who is to be trained.

565
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:29,552
A Jedi must have the deepest commitment...

566
00:56:29,637 --> 00:56:31,513
the most serious mind.

567
00:56:33,474 --> 00:56:36,601
This one a long time have I watched.

568
00:56:37,645 --> 00:56:40,438
All his life has he looked away...

569
00:56:40,523 --> 00:56:43,608
to the future, to the horizon.

570
00:56:43,693 --> 00:56:47,320
Never his mind on where he was...

571
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:50,657
what he was doing.

572
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:53,368
Adventure.

573
00:56:54,704 --> 00:56:56,371
Excitement.

574
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:58,790
A Jedi craves not these things.

575
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:01,501
You are reckless.

576
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:04,587
So was I, if you remember.

577
00:57:04,672 --> 00:57:06,756
He is too old.

578
00:57:08,718 --> 00:57:10,927
Yes, too old to begin the training.

579
00:57:11,012 --> 00:57:13,013
But I've learned so much.

580
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:24,065
- Will he finish what he begins?
- I won't fail you.

581
00:57:25,568 --> 00:57:27,277
I'm not afraid.

582
00:57:31,741 --> 00:57:33,825
You will be.

583
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:37,037
You will be.

584
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,624
- Sir, if I may venture an opinion...
- I'm not interested in your opinion.

585
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,751
There's something out there.

586
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,878
- Where?
- Outside in the cave.

587
00:58:28,506 --> 00:58:30,048
There it is. Listen!

588
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:32,050
- I'm going out there.
- Are you crazy?

589
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:34,719
I just got this bucket together.
I won't let it get torn apart.

590
00:58:34,804 --> 00:58:36,971
Then I'm going with you.

591
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:41,309
I think it might be better
if I stay behind and guard the ship.

592
00:58:41,394 --> 00:58:42,435
Oh, no.

593
00:58:57,493 --> 00:58:59,577
This ground sure feels strange.

594
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:03,248
It doesn't feel like rock.

595
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:10,338
There's an awful lot of moisture in here.

596
00:59:10,423 --> 00:59:14,175
I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.

597
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,510
Yeah.

598
00:59:17,555 --> 00:59:18,513
Watch out!

599
00:59:19,598 --> 00:59:22,100
It's all right. It's all right.

600
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:24,686
Yeah, that's what I thought... mynock.

601
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:27,939
Chewie, check the rest of the ship and
make sure there are no more attached...

602
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:29,941
chewing on the power cables.

603
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:31,651
Mynocks?

604
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:33,987
Go inside. We'll clean them off
if there are any more.

605
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:45,665
Go away! Go away, beastly thing! Shoo!

606
00:59:52,882 --> 00:59:54,757
Wait a minute.

607
01:00:16,447 --> 01:00:19,908
- Chewie, let's get out of here!
- The Empire is still out there!

608
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:22,076
No time to discuss this in committee!

609
01:00:22,912 --> 01:00:24,996
I am not a committee!

610
01:00:30,419 --> 01:00:33,296
You can't make the jump to light speed
in this asteroid field.

611
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,882
Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off.

612
01:00:40,638 --> 01:00:42,013
- Look!
- I see it.

613
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:44,516
- We're doomed!
- The cave is collapsing.

614
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,559
- This is no cave.
- What?

615
01:01:18,968 --> 01:01:20,385
Yes, run.

616
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:22,053
Yes.

617
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:25,515
A Jedi's strength flows from the Force.

618
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:29,060
But beware of the dark side.
Anger, fear, aggression...

619
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:31,354
The dark side of the Force are they.

620
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:35,066
Easily they flow,
quick to join you in a fight.

621
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,402
If once you start down the dark path...

622
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:39,821
forever will it dominate your destiny.

623
01:01:39,905 --> 01:01:43,908
Consume you it will,
as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.

624
01:01:43,993 --> 01:01:45,868
Vader.

625
01:01:45,953 --> 01:01:49,080
- Is the dark side stronger?
- No, no.

626
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:52,792
Quicker, easier, more seductive.

627
01:01:53,627 --> 01:01:55,753
How am I to know the good side from the bad?

628
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:58,131
You will know...

629
01:01:58,215 --> 01:02:00,508
when you are calm, at peace...

630
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:03,011
passive.

631
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:08,266
A Jedi uses the Force
for knowledge and defense...

632
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:10,226
never for attack.

633
01:02:10,311 --> 01:02:13,980
- But tell me why I can't...
- No. There is no why.

634
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:16,858
Nothing more will I teach you today.

635
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:18,985
Clear your mind of questions.

636
01:02:42,009 --> 01:02:44,010
There's something not right here.

637
01:02:47,848 --> 01:02:49,349
I feel cold.

638
01:02:50,142 --> 01:02:51,726
- Death.
- That place...

639
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:56,356
is strong with the dark side of the Force.

640
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,399
A domain of evil it is.

641
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:01,819
In you must go.

642
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:04,197
What's in there?

643
01:03:06,784 --> 01:03:09,243
Only what you take with you.

644
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:14,248
Your weapons...

645
01:03:15,084 --> 01:03:16,584
you will not need them.

646
01:05:56,662 --> 01:05:59,121
Bounty hunters. We don't need their scum.

647
01:05:59,206 --> 01:06:02,208
- Yes, sir.
- Those rebels won't escape us.

648
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,175
Sir, we have a priority signal
from the Stardestroyer Avenger.

649
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:12,844
Right.

650
01:06:12,928 --> 01:06:18,766
There will be a substantial reward for
the one who finds the Millennium Falcon.

651
01:06:18,851 --> 01:06:21,936
You are free to use any methods necessary...

652
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,188
but I want them alive.

653
01:06:24,273 --> 01:06:26,732
No disintegrations.

654
01:06:26,817 --> 01:06:28,734
- As you wish.
- Lord Vader.

655
01:06:30,946 --> 01:06:32,905
My lord, we have them.

656
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:40,454
Thank goodness
we're coming out of the asteroid field.

657
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:48,170
Let's get out of here. Ready for light speed?

658
01:06:48,255 --> 01:06:50,631
One, two...

659
01:06:50,716 --> 01:06:51,883
three!

660
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:00,766
It's not fair.

661
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:05,146
Transfer circuits aren't working.
It's not my fault.

662
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:08,232
- No light speed?
- It's not my fault.

663
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:14,989
Sir, we just lost
the main rear deflector shield.

664
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:17,366
One more direct hit
on the back quarter and we're done for.

665
01:07:17,451 --> 01:07:19,201
Turn her around.

666
01:07:19,286 --> 01:07:21,954
Turn her around! I'm gonna
put all power in the front shield.

667
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:24,081
- You're gonna attack?
- The odds of surviving...

668
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:26,125
a direct assault
on an imperial Stardestroyer...

669
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:28,169
Shut up!

670
01:07:34,635 --> 01:07:36,636
They're moving to attack position.

671
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:39,972
Shields up.

672
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,397
Track them. They may
come around for another pass.

673
01:07:48,482 --> 01:07:51,442
Captain Needa, the ship no longer
appears on our scopes.

674
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:55,363
They can't have disappeared. No ship
that small has a cloaking device.

675
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:59,325
- There's no trace of them.
- Captain, Lord Vader demands an update.

676
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,372
Get a shuttle ready.

677
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:08,417
I shall assume full responsibility for
losing them and apologize to Lord Vader.

678
01:08:08,502 --> 01:08:11,629
- Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.
- Yes, Captain Needa.

679
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:18,594
Use the Force.

680
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:19,720
Yes.

681
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:27,103
Now, the stone.

682
01:08:31,233 --> 01:08:32,900
Feel it.

683
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:46,414
Concentrate!

684
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:04,140
Oh, no. We'll never get it out now.

685
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:06,017
So certain are you.

686
01:09:10,022 --> 01:09:13,274
Always with you it cannot be done.

687
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:16,485
Hear you nothing that I say?

688
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:18,696
Master, moving stones around is one thing.

689
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,656
This is totally different.

690
01:09:20,741 --> 01:09:23,034
No. No different.

691
01:09:23,118 --> 01:09:25,244
Only different in your mind.

692
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:28,581
You must unlearn what you have learned.

693
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:33,085
- All right. I'll give it a try.
- Try not.

694
01:09:33,879 --> 01:09:35,337
Do...

695
01:09:35,422 --> 01:09:37,048
or do not.

696
01:09:37,132 --> 01:09:38,883
There is no try.

697
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:30,392
I can't. It's too big.

698
01:10:30,477 --> 01:10:32,561
Size matters not.

699
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:35,689
Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you?

700
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:41,320
And well you should not...

701
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:44,073
for my ally is the Force.

702
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:46,575
And a powerful ally it is.

703
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:50,037
Life creates it...

704
01:10:50,122 --> 01:10:52,206
makes it grow.

705
01:10:53,041 --> 01:10:55,876
Its energy surrounds us...

706
01:10:56,878 --> 01:10:58,712
and binds us.

707
01:10:58,797 --> 01:11:02,049
Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter.

708
01:11:03,093 --> 01:11:06,387
You must feel the Force around you.

709
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:09,849
Here, between you, me...

710
01:11:10,517 --> 01:11:14,520
the tree, the rock... everywhere.

711
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:16,605
Yes...

712
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:20,693
even between the land and the ship.

713
01:11:25,365 --> 01:11:27,825
You want the impossible.

714
01:13:15,183 --> 01:13:17,434
I don't believe it.

715
01:13:19,187 --> 01:13:22,064
That is why you fail.

716
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:44,586
Apology accepted, Captain Needa.

717
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:56,140
Lord Vader, our ships have completed
their scan and found nothing.

718
01:13:56,224 --> 01:13:58,225
If the Millennium Falcon
went into light speed...

719
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:00,269
it'll be on the other side of the galaxy now.

720
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:02,104
Alert all commands.

721
01:14:02,188 --> 01:14:06,608
Calculate every possible destination
along their last known trajectory.

722
01:14:06,693 --> 01:14:10,154
- Yes, my lord. We'll find them.
- Don't fail me again...

723
01:14:11,031 --> 01:14:13,073
Admiral.

724
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:18,537
Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet.

725
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:36,722
Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far.

726
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:39,933
I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

727
01:14:40,018 --> 01:14:42,102
The fleet's beginning to break up.

728
01:14:42,187 --> 01:14:45,105
Go stand by the manual release
for the landing claw.

729
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,443
I really don't see how that's going to help.

730
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:53,030
Surrender is a perfectly acceptable
alternative in extreme circumstances.

731
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:55,240
The Empire may be gracious enough...

732
01:14:55,325 --> 01:14:57,785
- Thank you.
- What did you have in mind next?

733
01:14:57,869 --> 01:14:59,828
If they follow standard imperial procedure...

734
01:14:59,913 --> 01:15:02,122
they'll dump their garbage
before they go to light speed.

735
01:15:02,207 --> 01:15:05,334
- Then we just float away.
- With the rest of the garbage.

736
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:06,877
Then what?

737
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:10,255
Then we gotta find a safe port
somewhere around here.

738
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:11,757
Any ideas?

739
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:14,259
- Where are we?
- The Anoat system.

740
01:15:14,344 --> 01:15:16,970
The Anoat system. There's not much there.

741
01:15:17,055 --> 01:15:19,932
Oh, wait. This is interesting.

742
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:22,935
- Lando.
- Lando system?

743
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:26,647
Lando's not a system.
He's a man. Lando Calrissian.

744
01:15:26,731 --> 01:15:29,024
Cardplayer, gambler.

745
01:15:29,109 --> 01:15:31,735
- A scoundrel. You'd like him.
- Thanks.

746
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:34,530
Bespin. It's pretty far,
but I think we can make it.

747
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:39,076
- A mining colony?
- Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.

748
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:42,079
Lando conned somebody out of it.

749
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:44,915
We go back a long way, Lando and me.

750
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:49,002
- Can you trust him?
- No.

751
01:15:49,087 --> 01:15:52,005
But he's got no love for the Empire.
I can tell you that.

752
01:15:52,841 --> 01:15:55,759
Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach.

753
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:04,476
You do have your moments.

754
01:16:05,145 --> 01:16:08,105
Not many of them, but you do have them.

755
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:44,892
Concentrate.

756
01:16:44,976 --> 01:16:48,228
Feel the Force flow.

757
01:16:48,313 --> 01:16:50,022
Yes.

758
01:16:57,614 --> 01:16:59,323
Good.

759
01:16:59,407 --> 01:17:00,824
Calm.

760
01:17:00,909 --> 01:17:02,326
Yes.

761
01:17:02,994 --> 01:17:05,787
Through the Force, things you will see.

762
01:17:05,872 --> 01:17:09,374
Other places. The future. The past.

763
01:17:09,459 --> 01:17:11,919
Old friends long gone.

764
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:23,889
Control, control.

765
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:26,225
You must learn control.

766
01:17:29,062 --> 01:17:32,231
I saw a city in the clouds.

767
01:17:34,234 --> 01:17:36,443
Friends you have there.

768
01:17:37,487 --> 01:17:41,198
- They were in pain.
- It is the future you see.

769
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:43,408
Future?

770
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:53,794
Will they die?

771
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:59,132
Difficult to see.

772
01:17:59,217 --> 01:18:01,760
Always in motion is the future.

773
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:05,639
I've gotta go to them.

774
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:10,686
Decide you must how to serve them best.

775
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:13,689
If you leave now, help them you could...

776
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:18,318
but you would destroy all
for which they have fought and suffered.

777
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,168
No, I don't have a landing permit.

778
01:18:35,253 --> 01:18:38,922
I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.

779
01:18:39,007 --> 01:18:41,174
Wait a minute! Let me explain!

780
01:18:41,259 --> 01:18:43,260
You will not deviate from your present course.

781
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:46,138
- Rather touchy, aren't they?
- I thought you knew this person.

782
01:18:48,975 --> 01:18:51,810
That was a long time ago.
I'm sure he's forgotten about that.

783
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:04,031
Permission granted to land on Platform 327.

784
01:19:04,115 --> 01:19:05,532
Thank you.

785
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:09,328
Nothing to worry about.
We go way back, Lando and me.

786
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:11,163
Who's worried?

787
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:01,380
No one to meet us.

788
01:20:02,757 --> 01:20:05,133
I don't like this.

789
01:20:05,218 --> 01:20:08,095
- What would you like?
- They did let us land.

790
01:20:08,179 --> 01:20:10,931
Look, don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine.

791
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:12,724
Trust me.

792
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:19,481
See? My friend.

793
01:20:23,695 --> 01:20:25,946
Keep your eyes open.

794
01:20:28,408 --> 01:20:30,283
Hey.

795
01:20:30,368 --> 01:20:34,496
Why, you slimy, double-crossing,
no-good swindler.

796
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:38,875
You've got a lot of guts coming here,
after what you pulled.

797
01:20:49,303 --> 01:20:52,806
How you doin', you old pirate?
So good to see you!

798
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:55,976
- I never thought I'd see you again.
- Well, he seems very friendly.

799
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:59,187
Yes. Very friendly.

800
01:20:59,272 --> 01:21:00,939
What are you doing here?

801
01:21:01,023 --> 01:21:03,066
Repairs. I thought you could help me out.

802
01:21:03,151 --> 01:21:05,819
- What have you done to my ship?
- Your ship?

803
01:21:05,903 --> 01:21:09,489
Hey, remember,
you lost her to me fair and square.

804
01:21:10,324 --> 01:21:11,783
How you doin', Chewbacca?

805
01:21:12,452 --> 01:21:15,412
Still hanging around with this loser?

806
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:19,750
Hello. What have we here?

807
01:21:20,668 --> 01:21:24,588
Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian.
I'm the administrator of this facility.

808
01:21:24,672 --> 01:21:27,799
- And who might you be?
- Leia.

809
01:21:27,884 --> 01:21:29,551
Welcome, Leia.

810
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:35,223
All right, all right. You old smoothie.

811
01:21:35,308 --> 01:21:38,685
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

812
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:41,897
My facilities are at your... Well, really!

813
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:44,399
- What's wrong with the Falcon?
- Hyperdrive.

814
01:21:44,484 --> 01:21:46,568
- I'll get my people to work on her.
- Good.

815
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:48,737
That ship saved my life quite a few times.

816
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:51,406
She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.

817
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:55,202
How's the gas mine? Still paying off for you?

818
01:21:55,286 --> 01:21:59,164
Not as well as I'd like. We're a small
outpost and not very self-sufficient.

819
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:02,375
I've had supply problems of every kind.

820
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:04,669
I've had labor difficulties.

821
01:22:04,754 --> 01:22:08,048
- What's so funny?
- You. Listen to you.

822
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:10,967
You sound like a businessman,
a responsible leader.

823
01:22:11,052 --> 01:22:12,969
Who'd have thought that, huh?

824
01:22:13,054 --> 01:22:16,014
Seeing you sure brings back a few things.

825
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:17,349
Yeah.

826
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:19,601
Yeah, I'm responsible these days.

827
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:23,146
It's the price you pay for being successful.

828
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:28,443
Nice to see a familiar face.

829
01:22:28,528 --> 01:22:30,195
How rude!

830
01:22:31,739 --> 01:22:33,824
That sounds like an R2 unit in there.

831
01:22:33,908 --> 01:22:35,534
I wonder if... Hello?

832
01:22:37,745 --> 01:22:39,329
How interesting.

833
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:42,541
- Who are you?
- Oh, my. I'm terribly sorry.

834
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:44,709
I didn't mean to intrude. Please don't get up.

835
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:05,772
Luke, you must complete the training.

836
01:23:06,816 --> 01:23:09,651
I can't keep the vision out of my head.
I've gotta help them.

837
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:11,903
You must not go.

838
01:23:11,988 --> 01:23:15,115
- But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
- You don't know that.

839
01:23:17,952 --> 01:23:20,787
Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

840
01:23:20,872 --> 01:23:23,665
But I can help them. I feel the Force.

841
01:23:23,749 --> 01:23:25,959
But you cannot control it.

842
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:28,503
This is a dangerous time for you...

843
01:23:28,588 --> 01:23:31,631
when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the Force.

844
01:23:31,716 --> 01:23:34,968
Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen.

845
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:37,262
The cave.

846
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:39,472
Remember your failure at the cave.

847
01:23:39,557 --> 01:23:41,516
But I've learned so much since then.

848
01:23:41,601 --> 01:23:44,311
Master Yoda, I promise to return
and finish what I've begun.

849
01:23:44,395 --> 01:23:46,396
You have my word.

850
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,316
It is you and your abilities
the emperor wants.

851
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:52,152
That is why your friends are made to suffer.

852
01:23:53,571 --> 01:23:56,281
That's why I have to go.

853
01:23:56,365 --> 01:24:00,744
Luke, I don't want to lose you
to the emperor the way I lost Vader.

854
01:24:00,828 --> 01:24:02,412
You won't.

855
01:24:03,164 --> 01:24:06,833
Stopped they must be. On this all depends.

856
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:11,171
Only a fully trained Jedi knight,
with the Force as his ally...

857
01:24:11,255 --> 01:24:13,882
will conquer Vader and his emperor.

858
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:16,092
If you end your training now...

859
01:24:16,177 --> 01:24:20,513
if you choose the quick and easy path,
as Vader did...

860
01:24:20,598 --> 01:24:23,266
you will become an agent of evil.

861
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:24,351
Patience.

862
01:24:25,269 --> 01:24:29,689
- And sacrifice Han and Leia?
- If you honor what they fight for...

863
01:24:29,774 --> 01:24:30,815
yes.

864
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:34,027
If you choose to face Vader,
you will do it alone.

865
01:24:34,111 --> 01:24:36,154
I cannot interfere.

866
01:24:38,115 --> 01:24:39,491
I understand.

867
01:24:44,914 --> 01:24:47,791
R2, fire up the converters.

868
01:24:53,089 --> 01:24:55,090
Don't give in to hate.

869
01:24:55,174 --> 01:24:57,968
That leads to the dark side.

870
01:24:58,052 --> 01:24:59,803
Strong is Vader.

871
01:24:59,887 --> 01:25:02,472
Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.

872
01:25:03,349 --> 01:25:04,891
I will.

873
01:25:04,976 --> 01:25:07,477
And I'll return. I promise.

874
01:25:14,527 --> 01:25:17,612
Told you, I did. Reckless is he.

875
01:25:17,697 --> 01:25:19,322
Now...

876
01:25:19,407 --> 01:25:21,199
matters are worse.

877
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:23,368
That boy is our last hope.

878
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:26,413
No, there is another.

879
01:25:58,529 --> 01:26:01,865
The ship's almost finished. Two or three
more things and we're in great shape.

880
01:26:01,949 --> 01:26:04,034
The sooner the better. Something's wrong here.

881
01:26:04,118 --> 01:26:06,202
No one has seen or knows anything about 3PO.

882
01:26:06,287 --> 01:26:08,538
He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.

883
01:26:08,622 --> 01:26:10,373
Relax.

884
01:26:10,458 --> 01:26:13,376
I'll talk to Lando
and see what I can find out.

885
01:26:13,461 --> 01:26:15,962
I don't trust Lando.

886
01:26:16,047 --> 01:26:19,424
Well, I don't trust him either,
but he is my friend.

887
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:22,218
Besides, we'll soon be gone.

888
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:25,722
Then you're as good as gone, aren't you?

889
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:02,258
What happened?

890
01:27:03,302 --> 01:27:04,010
Where?

891
01:27:06,138 --> 01:27:08,181
Found him in a junk pile?

892
01:27:08,265 --> 01:27:10,850
What a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?

893
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:16,523
- Lando's got people that can fix him.
- No, thanks.

894
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:19,984
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything?

895
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:22,028
Not really.

896
01:27:25,533 --> 01:27:27,575
You look absolutely beautiful.

897
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:30,995
You truly belong here
with us among the clouds.

898
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:32,580
Thank you.

899
01:27:32,665 --> 01:27:35,625
Would you join me for a little refreshment?

900
01:27:35,709 --> 01:27:38,545
Everyone's invited, of course.

901
01:27:38,629 --> 01:27:40,755
Having trouble with your droid?

902
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:43,508
No. No problem. Why?

903
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:54,853
You see, since we're a small operation...

904
01:27:54,937 --> 01:27:58,231
we don't fall into
the jurisdiction of the Empire.

905
01:27:58,315 --> 01:28:00,900
- So you're part of the Mining Guild?
- No, not actually.

906
01:28:00,985 --> 01:28:03,194
Our operation is small enough
not to be noticed.

907
01:28:03,279 --> 01:28:05,363
Which is advantageous for everybody...

908
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:09,909
since our customers are anxious to avoid
attracting attention to themselves.

909
01:28:09,994 --> 01:28:13,913
Aren't you afraid the Empire's
gonna find out, shut you down?

910
01:28:13,998 --> 01:28:17,333
It's been a danger that looms like
a shadow over everything we've built.

911
01:28:17,418 --> 01:28:20,170
But things have developed
that'll ensure security.

912
01:28:20,254 --> 01:28:23,590
I've just made a deal that'll keep
the Empire out of here forever.

913
01:28:33,267 --> 01:28:36,102
We would be honored if you would join us.

914
01:28:42,902 --> 01:28:45,403
I had no choice.
They arrived right before you did.

915
01:28:46,197 --> 01:28:48,031
I'm sorry.

916
01:28:51,452 --> 01:28:52,869
I'm sorry too.

917
01:29:07,635 --> 01:29:09,093
No, 3PO's with them.

918
01:29:10,429 --> 01:29:12,597
Just hang on. We're almost there.

919
01:30:12,074 --> 01:30:14,575
I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to intrude.

920
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:16,661
No, please don't get up.

921
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:25,878
Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger.

922
01:30:25,963 --> 01:30:28,589
I must tell the others.
Oh, no! I've been shot!

923
01:30:56,285 --> 01:30:58,036
Lord Vader.

924
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:00,538
You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hutt...

925
01:31:00,622 --> 01:31:02,665
after I have Skywalker.

926
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:04,667
He's no good to me dead.

927
01:31:04,752 --> 01:31:08,087
He will not be permanently damaged.

928
01:31:10,466 --> 01:31:13,051
Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?

929
01:31:13,135 --> 01:31:15,887
They must never again leave this city.

930
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:19,223
That wasn't part of our agreement,
nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!

931
01:31:19,308 --> 01:31:23,269
Perhaps you think you're
being treated unfairly?

932
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:27,023
No.

933
01:31:27,107 --> 01:31:30,735
Good. It would be unfortunate
if I had to leave a garrison here.

934
01:31:33,072 --> 01:31:35,490
This deal is getting worse all the time.

935
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:39,077
Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that.

936
01:31:40,662 --> 01:31:43,247
Something's not right because now I can't see.

937
01:31:45,751 --> 01:31:48,002
That's much better.

938
01:31:48,087 --> 01:31:49,754
Wait. Wait.

939
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:51,923
Oh, my! What have you done?

940
01:31:52,007 --> 01:31:53,591
I'm backwards!

941
01:31:53,675 --> 01:31:55,593
You flea-bitten furball!

942
01:31:55,677 --> 01:31:58,388
Only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough...

943
01:32:12,945 --> 01:32:14,946
I feel terrible.

944
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:32,255
Why are they doing this?

945
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:37,427
They never even asked me any questions.

946
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:48,938
- Get out of here, Lando.
- Shut up and listen.

947
01:32:49,022 --> 01:32:52,150
Vader's agreed
to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.

948
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:54,152
They'll have to stay here,
but they'll be safe.

949
01:32:54,236 --> 01:32:56,404
- And Han?
- Vader's given him to the bounty hunter.

950
01:32:56,488 --> 01:32:58,948
- Vader wants us all dead.
- He doesn't want you at all.

951
01:32:59,032 --> 01:33:02,452
He's after somebody called Skywalker.

952
01:33:02,536 --> 01:33:05,121
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.
- And we're the bait.

953
01:33:05,205 --> 01:33:07,123
- He's on his way.
- Perfect.

954
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,251
You fixed us all real good, didn't you?

955
01:33:10,335 --> 01:33:11,544
My friend.

956
01:33:13,839 --> 01:33:15,047
Stop!

957
01:33:17,009 --> 01:33:19,218
I've done all I can.

958
01:33:19,303 --> 01:33:21,762
Sorry I couldn't do better,
but I got my own problems.

959
01:33:21,847 --> 01:33:23,181
Yeah.

960
01:33:23,265 --> 01:33:25,183
You're a real hero.

961
01:33:35,903 --> 01:33:38,404
You certainly have a way with people.

962
01:33:52,753 --> 01:33:54,629
This facility is crude...

963
01:33:54,713 --> 01:33:57,840
but it should be adequate
to freeze Skywalker...

964
01:33:57,925 --> 01:34:00,218
for his journey to the emperor.

965
01:34:00,302 --> 01:34:03,346
Lord Vader, ship approaching, X-wing class.

966
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:06,849
Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.

967
01:34:08,352 --> 01:34:13,105
Lord Vader, we only use this facility
for carbon freezing. It might kill him.

968
01:34:13,190 --> 01:34:16,108
I do not want the emperor's prize damaged.

969
01:34:16,193 --> 01:34:19,320
We will test it on Captain Solo.

970
01:34:43,053 --> 01:34:47,306
If you'd attached my legs I wouldn't
be in this ridiculous position.

971
01:34:47,391 --> 01:34:50,101
Now remember, Chewbacca,
you have a responsibility for me...

972
01:34:50,185 --> 01:34:51,936
so don't do anything foolish.

973
01:35:05,909 --> 01:35:08,119
What's going on, buddy?

974
01:35:08,954 --> 01:35:11,122
You're being put into carbon freeze.

975
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:14,750
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.

976
01:35:14,835 --> 01:35:18,296
The Empire will compensate you
if he dies. Put him in.

977
01:35:22,175 --> 01:35:23,384
Chewbacca, stop!

978
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:25,511
No, Chewie, stop!

979
01:35:25,596 --> 01:35:28,639
You're going to get us all killed!
Yes, stop. I'm not ready to die.

980
01:35:28,724 --> 01:35:30,725
Hey! Hey! Listen to me.

981
01:35:30,809 --> 01:35:33,352
Chewie, this won't help me.

982
01:35:33,437 --> 01:35:36,105
Hey, save your strength.
There'll be another time.

983
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:39,567
The princess.

984
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:41,485
You have to take care of her.

985
01:35:43,655 --> 01:35:45,698
Do you hear me?

986
01:35:59,546 --> 01:36:02,548
- I love you.
- I know.

987
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:35,373
What's going on? Turn round. I can't see.

988
01:37:34,474 --> 01:37:36,267
They've encased him in carbonite.

989
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:38,269
He should be quite well-protected...

990
01:37:38,353 --> 01:37:40,312
if he survived the freezing process, that is.

991
01:37:40,397 --> 01:37:42,940
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

992
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:44,692
Yes, he's alive.

993
01:37:45,527 --> 01:37:47,445
And in perfect hibernation.

994
01:37:48,363 --> 01:37:50,573
He's all yours, bounty hunter.

995
01:37:51,366 --> 01:37:53,117
Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

996
01:37:55,495 --> 01:37:57,371
Skywalker has just landed, lord.

997
01:37:57,456 --> 01:38:01,417
Good. See to it that he finds his way in here.

998
01:38:05,589 --> 01:38:07,506
Calrissian...

999
01:38:07,591 --> 01:38:10,050
take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.

1000
01:38:10,135 --> 01:38:12,303
You said they'd be left under my supervision.

1001
01:38:12,387 --> 01:38:17,308
I am altering the deal.
Pray I don't alter it any further.

1002
01:39:54,531 --> 01:39:57,116
Luke, don't! It's a trap!

1003
01:39:58,577 --> 01:39:59,743
It's a trap!

1004
01:40:46,082 --> 01:40:48,500
The Force is with you, young Skywalker.

1005
01:40:50,879 --> 01:40:52,963
But you are not a Jedi yet.

1006
01:41:54,859 --> 01:41:56,610
Well done.

1007
01:41:58,363 --> 01:42:01,198
Hold them in the security tower.
And keep it quiet.

1008
01:42:01,282 --> 01:42:03,033
Move.

1009
01:42:07,414 --> 01:42:10,749
- What do you think you're doing?
- We're getting out of here.

1010
01:42:10,834 --> 01:42:12,626
I knew all along. It had to be a mistake.

1011
01:42:12,711 --> 01:42:15,587
Do you think that after what you did to Han...

1012
01:42:16,548 --> 01:42:19,883
- I had no choice.
- What are you doing? Trust him!

1013
01:42:19,968 --> 01:42:23,012
We understand, don't we, Chewie?
He had no choice.

1014
01:42:23,096 --> 01:42:24,680
I'm just trying to help.

1015
01:42:24,764 --> 01:42:27,433
We don't need any of your help.

1016
01:42:32,522 --> 01:42:34,064
What?

1017
01:42:34,149 --> 01:42:38,777
- It sounds like Han.
- There's still a chance to save Han...

1018
01:42:39,696 --> 01:42:43,032
at the east... platform.

1019
01:42:47,162 --> 01:42:49,329
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1020
01:42:49,414 --> 01:42:51,248
After all, he's only a Wookiee.

1021
01:42:52,125 --> 01:42:54,835
Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.

1022
01:43:10,018 --> 01:43:12,311
R2, where have you been?

1023
01:43:12,395 --> 01:43:14,313
Wait. Turn around, you woolly...

1024
01:43:15,482 --> 01:43:18,275
Hurry! We're trying to save
Han from the bounty hunter.

1025
01:43:20,987 --> 01:43:23,447
Well, at least you're still in one piece.

1026
01:43:23,531 --> 01:43:25,949
Look what's happened to me.

1027
01:43:37,837 --> 01:43:40,464
Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!

1028
01:43:53,394 --> 01:43:55,771
You have learned much, young one.

1029
01:43:55,855 --> 01:43:57,981
You'll find I'm full of surprises.

1030
01:44:09,577 --> 01:44:12,704
Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.

1031
01:44:13,414 --> 01:44:16,041
Obi-Wan knew this to be true.

1032
01:44:24,092 --> 01:44:25,509
All too easy.

1033
01:44:30,682 --> 01:44:33,183
Perhaps you're not as strong
as the emperor thought.

1034
01:44:36,312 --> 01:44:38,021
Impressive.

1035
01:44:39,899 --> 01:44:41,358
Most impressive.

1036
01:44:49,075 --> 01:44:52,911
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You have controlled your fear.

1037
01:44:55,665 --> 01:44:58,917
Now, release your anger.

1038
01:44:59,002 --> 01:45:01,670
Only your hatred can destroy me.

1039
01:47:12,552 --> 01:47:14,511
The security code has been changed.

1040
01:47:14,595 --> 01:47:17,973
R2, you can tell the computer
to override the security systems.

1041
01:47:18,850 --> 01:47:20,600
R2, hurry.

1042
01:47:23,354 --> 01:47:26,189
Attention.
This is Lando Calrissian. Attention.

1043
01:47:26,274 --> 01:47:28,275
The Empire has taken control of the city.

1044
01:47:28,359 --> 01:47:31,236
I advise everyone to leave
before more imperial troops arrive.

1045
01:47:37,702 --> 01:47:39,369
This way.

1046
01:47:39,454 --> 01:47:41,705
Well, don't blame me. I'm an interpreter.

1047
01:47:41,789 --> 01:47:44,708
I'm not supposed to know a power socket
from a computer terminal.

1048
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:09,232
We're not interested in the hyperdrive
on the falcon. It's fixed!

1049
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:17,074
Just open the door, you stupid lump!

1050
01:48:25,583 --> 01:48:28,085
I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!

1051
01:48:52,527 --> 01:48:55,278
That hurts! Bend down, you thoughtless... Ow!

1052
01:49:02,370 --> 01:49:03,787
Go!

1053
01:49:10,169 --> 01:49:13,004
I thought that hairy beast
would be the end of me.

1054
01:49:13,089 --> 01:49:15,006
Of course I've looked better.

1055
01:50:08,644 --> 01:50:12,355
You are beaten. It is useless to resist.

1056
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:15,984
Don't let yourself be destroyed
as Obi-Wan did.

1057
01:50:31,751 --> 01:50:33,418
There is no escape.

1058
01:50:34,253 --> 01:50:36,421
Don't make me destroy you.

1059
01:50:40,218 --> 01:50:43,178
You do not yet realize your importance.

1060
01:50:43,262 --> 01:50:45,972
You have only begun to discover your power.

1061
01:50:46,057 --> 01:50:47,933
Join me...

1062
01:50:48,017 --> 01:50:50,435
and I will complete your training.

1063
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:52,938
With our combined strength...

1064
01:50:53,022 --> 01:50:55,982
we can end this destructive conflict...

1065
01:50:56,067 --> 01:50:58,401
and bring order to the galaxy.

1066
01:50:58,486 --> 01:51:01,029
I'll never join you!

1067
01:51:01,113 --> 01:51:05,242
If you only knew the power of the dark side.

1068
01:51:05,326 --> 01:51:09,579
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

1069
01:51:09,664 --> 01:51:11,122
He told me enough.

1070
01:51:13,709 --> 01:51:15,585
He told me you killed him.

1071
01:51:17,338 --> 01:51:19,464
I am your father.

1072
01:51:27,974 --> 01:51:29,933
That's not true.

1073
01:51:30,768 --> 01:51:32,435
That's impossible!

1074
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:35,814
Search your feelings. You know it to be true.

1075
01:51:44,615 --> 01:51:48,785
You can destroy the emperor.
He has foreseen this.

1076
01:51:48,869 --> 01:51:51,788
It is your destiny.

1077
01:51:51,872 --> 01:51:53,623
Join me...

1078
01:51:53,708 --> 01:51:58,086
and together we can rule the galaxy
as father and son.

1079
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:10,307
Come with me.

1080
01:52:11,142 --> 01:52:13,351
It is the only way.

1081
01:53:19,585 --> 01:53:21,002
Ben.

1082
01:53:21,837 --> 01:53:23,713
Ben, please.

1083
01:53:51,617 --> 01:53:53,243
Hear me.

1084
01:54:00,167 --> 01:54:02,252
- We've got to go back.
- What?

1085
01:54:02,336 --> 01:54:04,754
- I know where Luke is.
- What about those fighters?

1086
01:54:05,798 --> 01:54:08,091
Chewie, just do it.

1087
01:54:08,175 --> 01:54:09,926
All right, all right!

1088
01:54:18,102 --> 01:54:22,230
Alert my Stardestroyer
to prepare for my arrival.

1089
01:54:32,700 --> 01:54:34,784
Look, someone's up there.

1090
01:54:35,995 --> 01:54:38,496
It's Luke. Chewie, slow down.

1091
01:54:38,581 --> 01:54:41,916
We'll get under him.
Lando, open the top hatch.

1092
01:54:57,808 --> 01:55:00,185
Okay. Easy, Chewie.

1093
01:55:21,916 --> 01:55:24,125
- Lando?
- Okay, let's go.

1094
01:55:44,104 --> 01:55:45,563
All right, Chewie. Let's go.

1095
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:22,976
I'll be back.

1096
01:56:28,649 --> 01:56:30,108
Stardestroyer.

1097
01:56:35,322 --> 01:56:37,824
All right, Chewie. Ready for light speed.

1098
01:56:37,908 --> 01:56:39,993
If your people fixed the hyperdrive.

1099
01:56:40,077 --> 01:56:42,453
All the coordinates are set.
It's now or never.

1100
01:56:42,538 --> 01:56:44,038
Punch it!

1101
01:56:54,675 --> 01:56:57,010
They told me they fixed it.

1102
01:56:57,094 --> 01:56:59,012
I trusted them!

1103
01:56:59,096 --> 01:57:01,639
It's not my fault!

1104
01:57:07,229 --> 01:57:09,898
They'll be in range
of our tractor beam in moments, lord.

1105
01:57:09,982 --> 01:57:13,568
Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive
on the Millennium Falcon?

1106
01:57:13,652 --> 01:57:15,695
- Yes, my lord.
- Good.

1107
01:57:15,779 --> 01:57:19,449
Prepare the boarding party
and set your weapons for stun.

1108
01:57:19,533 --> 01:57:22,619
- Yes, my lord. Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

1109
01:57:24,121 --> 01:57:27,457
Noisy brute. Why don't we
just go into light speed?

1110
01:57:27,541 --> 01:57:29,167
We can't?

1111
01:57:29,251 --> 01:57:31,669
How would you know
the hyperdrive is deactivated?

1112
01:57:34,924 --> 01:57:37,842
The city's central computer told you?

1113
01:57:37,927 --> 01:57:40,720
R2-D2, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.

1114
01:57:40,804 --> 01:57:44,140
Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing.

1115
01:57:56,403 --> 01:57:57,612
Father.

1116
01:57:59,448 --> 01:58:01,616
Son, come with me.

1117
01:58:04,620 --> 01:58:06,079
Ben.

1118
01:58:07,122 --> 01:58:09,248
Why didn't you tell me?

1119
01:58:27,434 --> 01:58:28,685
It's Vader.

1120
01:58:34,483 --> 01:58:38,111
Luke, it is your destiny.

1121
01:58:45,786 --> 01:58:48,079
Why didn't you tell me?

1122
01:58:54,336 --> 01:58:58,339
Alert all commands.
Ready for the tractor beam.

1123
01:59:01,719 --> 01:59:04,512
R2, come back at once!
You haven't finished with me yet.

1124
01:59:04,596 --> 01:59:08,141
You don't know how to fix the
hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it.

1125
01:59:08,225 --> 01:59:12,729
I'm standing here in pieces
and you're having delusions of grandeur!

1126
01:59:15,816 --> 01:59:17,358
You did it!

1127
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:18,086
- Luke, we're ready for takeoff.
- Good luck, Lando.

1128
02:00:19,046 --> 02:00:23,049
When we find Jabba the Hutt and
that bounty hunter, we'll contact you.

1129
02:00:23,133 --> 02:00:25,802
I'll meet you at
the rendezvous point on Tatooine.

1130
02:00:25,886 --> 02:00:29,347
Princess, we'll find Han. I promise.

1131
02:00:29,431 --> 02:00:31,682
Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal.

1132
02:00:31,767 --> 02:00:33,518
Take care, you two.

1133
02:00:33,602 --> 02:00:35,686
May the Force be with you.

1134
02:07:19,174 --> 02:07:20,174
English - US


1
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,361
Komentokeskus, täällä
ST-321, koodi Sininen.

2
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,410
Aloitamme lähestymisen.
Avatkaa suojakilpi.

3
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,688
Tarkistamme ensin koodinne.

Olkaa valmiina.

Koodi on tarkistettu.
- Aloitamme laskeutumisen.

6
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,928
Ilmoittakaa komentajalle,
että lordi Vader on saapunut.

7
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,969
Emme osanneet odottaa.
Tämä on meille kunnia.

8
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,001
Jätä turhat kohteliaisuudet.
Te olette jäljessä aikataulusta.

9
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,163
Mieheni työskentelevät
niin nopeasti kuin pystyvät.

10
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,722
Ehkä keksin uuden
tavan motivoida heitä.

11
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,004
Asema valmistuu ajallaan.

12
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,085
Keisari ei ole yhtä
optimistinen sen suhteen.

13
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,448
Hän vaatii mahdottomia.
Tarvitsen lisää miehiä.

14
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,683
Ehkä haluatte kertoa sen
hänelle, kun hän saapuu.

15
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,370
Tuleeko keisari tänne?

16
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:37,369
Tulee, ja hän on
tyytymätön vätystelyynne.

17
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,325
Yritämme entistä lujemmin.
- Se on viisainta.

18
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,371
Keisari ei anna yhtä
helposti anteeksi kuin minä.

19
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,720
Tietenkin olen huolissani
ja sinunkin pitäisi olla.

20
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,646
Lando ja Chewbacca eivät
ole tulleet takaisin.

21
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,090
Älä ole niin varma.
Jos kertoisin mitä olen kuullut -

22
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,482
Jabba the Huttista,
sinulta palaisi piuhat.

23
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,042
Onko tämä oikea paikka?

24
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,327
Pitää kai koputtaa.

25
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,085
Ei ketään.
Palataan Luke-herran luo.

26
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,568
Hyvänen aika!

27
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,241
Emme taida päästä sisään.

28
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,968
Lähdetään.

29
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,803
R2, odota!

30
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,968
Ei pitäisi ryntäillä.

31
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,804
Odota!

32
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,441
Anna Luken viesti
ja sitten lähdetään.

33
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,011
Meillä on viesti
Jabba the Huttille.

34
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,401
Ja lahja. Mikä lahja?

35
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,171
Saamme antaa viestin
vain itselleen Jabballe.

36
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,726
Se on niin itsepäinen.

37
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,567
Aavistan pahaa.

38
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,283
Huomenta.

39
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,801
Viesti, R2.

40
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,884
Tervehdys teidän ylevyytenne.
Saanko esitellä itseni?

41
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,931
Olen Luke Skywalker,
jediritari ja kapteeni Solon ystävä.

42
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,371
Tiedän että olette suuri, -

43
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,161
ja vihanne Soloa kohtaan
on vieläkin suurempaa.

44
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,131
Tulin käymään kauppaa hänestä.

45
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:32,161
Pääsemme varmasti molempia
tyydyttävään sopimukseen.

46
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,286
Hyvän tahdon eleenä
annan teille nämä droidit.

47
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,283
Mitä?

48
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,967
He ovat ahkeria
ja palvelevat teitä hyvin.

49
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,840
Tuo on väärä viesti!

50
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,243
Ei tuo ole mikään jedi.

51
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,687
En halua käydä kauppaa.

52
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,047
Olemme tuomittuja.

53
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:13,129
En halua luopua
lemmikkikoristeestani.

54
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,042
Kapteeni Solo jää tänne.

55
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,487
Katso, hän on yhä jäässä.

56
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,080
Mitä Luke-herralle
on tapahtunut?

57
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,130
Eihän hän ole koskaan
edes moittinut minua.

58
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,765
Uusia hankintoja...
Oletko protokolladroidi?

59
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,686
Olen C-3 PO.
- Olet vai ei?

60
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,926
Montako kieltä puhut?

61
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,648
Hallitsen 6 miljoonaa kieltä ja...
- Loistavaa.

62
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,449
Meillä ei olekaan ollut
tulkkia sen jälkeen, -

63
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,845
kun herramme suuttui
edelliseen ja tuhosi sen.

64
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,524
Tuhosi?

65
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,246
Tästä droidista
voi olla hyötyä meille.

66
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,009
Asenna siihen estopultti
ja vie se kokoussaliin.

67
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,606
R2, älä jätä!

68
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,482
Sinä olet ärhäkkä,
mutta opit vielä tavoille.

69
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,928
Sinulle on
hommia herramme parkissa.

70
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,731
Sovit sinne hyvin.

71
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,563
Ei, ei, ei!

72
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,722
Ihanaa! Uudestaan!

73
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,329
Tulin hakemaan
palkkioni tästä Wookiesta.

74
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,685
Voi ei, Chewbacca!

75
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,008
Lopultakin
saimme mahtavan Chewbaccan.

76
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,564
Olen tässä,
teidän ylhäisyytenne.

77
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,562
Maineikas Jabba toivottaa
teidät tervetulleeksi -

78
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,881
ja maksaa teille 25 000.

79
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,042
Haluan 50 000. Ei vähempää.

80
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,848
50 000, ota tai jätä.

81
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,524
Mitä minä sanoin?

82
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,525
Jabba kysyy, miksi hänen
pitäisi maksaa 50 000.

83
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,847
Siksi, että hänellä
on terminen laukaisin.

84
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,642
Tuo palkkionmetsästäjä
on samaa maata kuin minä.

85
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,404
Peloton ja kekseliäs.

86
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,971
Jabba tarjoaa 35 000.
Suosittelen ottamaan.

87
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,124
Hän suostuu.

88
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,720
Lepää nyt hetki.

89
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,485
Sulatin sinut juuri.

90
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,002
Olet ollut talviunessa.

91
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,608
En näe mitään.
- Näkösi palaa aikanaan.

92
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,048
Missä olen?
- Jabban palatsissa.

93
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,964
Kuka sinä olet?

94
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,446
Joku joka rakastaa sinua.
- Leia?

95
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,962
Vien sinut pois täältä.

96
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,364
Mitä tuo on?

97
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,003
Tunnen tuon naurun.

98
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,250
Olin tulossa maksamaan,
mutta sitten tuli este.

99
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,244
En voinut sille mitään.

100
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,086
Nyt on liian myöhäistä.

101
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,724
Olit ehkä hyvä salakuljettaja, -

102
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,491
mutta nyt olet banthan ruokaa.

103
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,442
Viekää hänet.

104
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,963
Jabba, maksan sinulle
kolminkertaisesti takaisin.

105
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,047
Tuokaa tyttö tänne.

106
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,329
Meillä on mahtavia ystäviä.
Tulet katumaan tätä.

107
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,328
Niin varmasti.

108
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,203
En voi katsoa.

109
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,210
Chewie?

110
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,962
Sinäkö siellä?

111
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,523
En näe. Mitä on tekeillä?

112
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,325
Lukeko? Eihän hän pysty
huolehtimaan edes itsestään.

113
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,083
Vai jediritari?

114
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,726
Kaikki sekoavat heti,
kun käännän selkäni.

115
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,083
Ei minulla ole hätää.

116
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,488
Minulla on asiaa Jabballe.

117
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,648
En neuvottele siitä.

118
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,246
Vie minut Jabban luokse.

119
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,483
Palvelet hyvin herraasi.

120
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,368
Sinut palkitaan.

121
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,522
Lopultakin Luke-herra
tuli pelastamaan minut.

122
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,209
Luke Skywalker, jediritari.

123
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,604
Kielsin sinua päästämästä häntä.

124
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,523
Meidän on puhuttava.

125
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,410
Hänen on saatava puhua.

126
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,204
Senkin heikko typerys!

127
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,569
Hän käyttää vanhaa
jeditemppua sinuun.

128
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,201
Luovutat kapteeni
Solon ja Wookien minulle.

129
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:18,291
Et kykene tunkeutumaan
minun mieleeni, poika.

130
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,685
Siitä huolimatta vien
Solon ja hänen ystävänsä.

131
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,651
Voit joko hyötyä
siitä tai tuhoutua.

132
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,724
Saat valita, mutta
älä aliarvioi voimiani.

133
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,048
Luke-herra, seisot...

134
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,768
En suostu yhteistyöhön.

135
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,527
Nautin katsellessani
sinun kuolemaasi.

136
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,245
Voi ei, rankori!

137
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,201
Tuokaa Solo ja Wookie.

138
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,524
Tämän he saavat maksaa.

139
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,003
Oletko kunnossa?
- Olen.

140
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,731
Miten menee?

141
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,531
Niin kuin aina.
- Ai niin huonosti.

142
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,126
Missä Leia on?
- Olen tässä.

143
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:56,361
Jabba the Hutt käski
surmata teidät heti.

144
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,169
Hyvä, vihaan odottelua.

145
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,566
Teidät heitetään Carkoon -

146
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,001
kuoppaan Sarlakin ruoaksi.

147
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,320
Ei hullumpaa.

148
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,325
Hänen vatsassaan
tuska ja kärsimys saavat -

149
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,563
uuden merkityksen,
kun sulatte yli tuhat vuotta.

150
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,971
Perun äskeisen.
- Olisit tehnyt kaupat.

151
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,246
Se oli viimeinen erehdyksesi.

152
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,484
Näköni alkaa palautua.

153
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,769
Tumman sotkun sijasta
näen vaaleata sotkua.

154
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,803
Et menetä mitään.
Minä olen asunut täällä.

155
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,770
Ja nyt kuolet.

156
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,161
Pysy vain CheWien ja Landon lähellä.

157
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,641
Minä hoidan tämän.

158
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,811
Hienoa.

159
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:49,286
Opit vielä arvostamaan minua.

160
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,530
Mitä sinä täällä teet?

161
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,683
Näen että tarjoilet juomia,
mutta täällä on vaarallista.

162
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,764
Luke-herra aiotaan teloittaa.

163
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,602
Olisinpa yhtä luottavainen.

164
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,081
Mahtavan Sarlakin uhrit, -

165
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,363
hänen ylhäisyytensä toivoo,
että kuolette arvokkaasti.

166
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:44,004
Jos haluatte anoa armoa,
suuri Jabba kuuntelee nyt.

167
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:53,490
3 PO, sano tuolle
limaiselle ihrakasalle, -

168
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:58,168
että sitä iloa emme anna.
Oletteko samaa mieltä?

169
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,561
Jabba, tämä on viimeinen
mahdollisuutesi.

170
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,802
Päästä meidät tai kuolet.

171
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,004
Viekää lankulle.

172
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,481
Työntäkää kuoppaan.

173
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,805
Apua!

174
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,761
Chewie, oletko kunnossa?
Missä hän on?

175
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,931
Boba Fett?

176
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,405
Missä?

177
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,568
Ota kiinni.
- Alemmas!

178
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,130
Minä yritän!

179
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,686
Pidä kiinni, Chewie!

180
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,641
Yletyit melkein.

181
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,521
Varovasti nyt.

182
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,804
Anna ase, Chewie.

183
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,929
Liikkumatta, Lando!
- Sinun piti olla sokea!

184
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,048
Äen jo hyvin. Älä liiku.

185
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,724
Ylemmäs!

186
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,888
Chewie, vedä.

187
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,044
Nyt lähdetään täältä.

188
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,529
Ei silmiä! Auta, R2!

189
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,121
Senkin peto!

190
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,329
Ota ase!

191
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,765
Tähtää kannelle!

192
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,804
Kannelle!

193
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,131
Minne olemme menossa?
En voi mitenkään...

194
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,326
Nyt mennään.
Älkää unohtako droideja.

195
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,609
Tavataan laivaston luona.

196
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,365
Vauhtia,joukkomme
ovat varmasti jo koolla.

197
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,882
Kiitos, Luke,
kun tulit pelastamaan.

198
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,691
Nyt minä olen sinulle
palveluksen velkaa.

199
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,680
Kyllä, R2, me menemme
Dagobahin järjestelmään.

200
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,443
Minun on pidettävä
ystävälle annettu lupaus.

201
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,090
Nouse, ystäväni.

202
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,088
Kuolemantähti
valmistuu aikataulussa.

203
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,326
Olet onnistunut.

204
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:55,282
Vaistoan, että haluat lähteä
nuoren Skywalkerin perään.

205
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,210
Kyllä, herrani.

206
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:06,041
Kärsivällisyyttä.
Aikanaan hän tulee sinun luoksesi.

207
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:10,603
Sitten sinä tuot hänet minulle.

208
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,001
Hänestä on tullut vahva.

209
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:18,809
Vain yhdessä voimme saada
hänet pimeälle puolelle.

210
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,723
Kuten haluatte.

211
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,330
Kaikki tapahtuu niin kuin
olen sen ennalta nähnyt.

212
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,250
Miksi noin katsot?
Vanhaltako näytän?

213
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,163
Ei, et toki.

214
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,164
Näytän.

215
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:15,002
Sairastunut olen.
Olen vanha ja heikko.

216
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,565
Et pirteältä sinäkään
näytä 900-vuotiaana.

217
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,562
Pian nukkua saan iäti.

218
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,803
Uneen ikuiseen.

219
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,084
Ansainnut olen sen.

220
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,845
Mestari Yoda, et saa kuolla.

221
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:48,201
Voiman kanssa vahva olen,
mutta tälle mitään en voi.

222
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,046
Hämärä laskeutunut minuun
on ja pian koittaa yö.

223
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,689
Niin se on.

224
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,962
Niin Voima toimii.

225
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:13,051
Mutta tarvitsen apuasi.
Koulutukseni on kesken.

226
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:18,570
Riittävästi osaat jo.

227
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,961
Olen siis jedi...

228
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,524
Et vielä.

229
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,648
Yksi asia jäljellä.

230
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:40,129
Kohdattava Vader on.

231
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,044
Vasta sitten olet jedi.

232
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,922
Ja hänet sinä kohtaat.

233
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,050
Mestari Yoda...

234
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,240
Onko Darth Vader isäni?

235
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,846
Lepoa tarvitsen nyt.

236
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,164
Lepoa.

237
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,042
Minun on saatava tietää.

238
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,607
Isäsi hän on.

239
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,451
Kertoiko hän sinulle?

240
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,525
Kyllä.

241
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:40,089
Odottamatonta se
oli ja valitettavaa.

242
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,882
Onko valitettavaa,
että tiedän totuuden?

243
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,325
Ei.

244
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,451
Valitettavaa oli,
että kohtaamaan ryntäsit hänet, -

245
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,126
vaikka lopussa ei
vielä koulutuksesi ollut.

246
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,721
Liian raskas taakka.

247
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,330
Olen pahoillani siitä.

248
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:10,044
Muista että jedin voima
virtaa häneen Voimasta.

249
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:20,524
Varo vihaa,
pelkoa ja aggressioita.

250
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,331
Ne pimeän puolella ovat.

251
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:31,606
Jos pimeän puolelle menet,
kohtalosi on sinetöity.

252
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,208
Älä keisaria aliarvioi -

253
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,767
tai isäsi kohtalon jaat.

254
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:03,247
Kun olen kuollut,
olet sinä viimeinen jedi.

255
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,810
Voima on vahvana suvussasi.

256
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,921
Välitä tietosi eteenpäin.

257
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,563
On vielä...

258
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,364
yksi toinenkin...

259
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:40,889
Skywalker.

260
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,563
En pysty siihen.

261
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,880
En voi mennä yksin.

262
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,167
Yoda on aina kanssasi.

263
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,531
Obi-Wan?

264
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:08,169
Miksi sanoit, että Vader
oli murhannut isäni?

265
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:13,770
Voiman pimeä puoli
sai otteen isästäsi.

266
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:17,811
Anakin Skywalkerista
tuli Darth Vader.

267
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,721
Kun se tapahtui,
hyvä isäsi tuhoutui.

268
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:28,169
Kerroin totuuden
tietystä näkökulmasta.

269
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,766
Kuinka niin näkökulmasta?

270
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:37,849
Totuus riippuu
usein näkökannastamme.

271
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,370
Anakin oli hyvä ystävä.

272
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:46,125
Tavatessamme isäsi oli
jo loistava lentäjä.

273
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,810
Mutta minua hämmästytti, -

274
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,882
miten vahvasti
Voima vaikutti hänessä.

275
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,965
Koulutin hänet jediksi.

276
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:59,450
Luulin olevani Yodan veroinen
opettaja, mutta olin väärässä.

277
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,283
Onko hänessä mitään hyvää?

278
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:07,241
Hän on kone, ei ihminen.
Turmeltunut ja paha.

279
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,201
En voi tehdä sitä.

280
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,650
Kohtaloaan ei voi paeta.
Sinun on kohdattava hänet.

281
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,610
En voi tappaa omaa isääni.

282
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,889
Silloin keisari
on jo voittanut.

283
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,201
Sinä olit ainoa toivomme.

284
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,602
Yoda puhui toisestakin.

285
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,285
Hän on kaksoissisaresi.

286
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,122
Ei minulla ole siskoa.

287
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,889
Teidät piilotettiin,
ettei keisari löytäisi teitä.

288
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,440
Keisari tiesi, kuten minäkin, -

289
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:55,971
että Anakinin jälkeläinen
olisi uhka hänelle.

290
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:01,331
Siksi sisaresi jäi
tuntemattomaksi kaikille.

291
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:07,882
Leia... Leia on sisareni.
- Vaistosi on oikeassa.

292
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,044
Hautaa nyt tunteesi.

293
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:17,809
Varo, etteivät ne joudu
keisarin palvelukseen.

294
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,931
Vai olet sinä kenraali.

295
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,129
Joku kai kertoi heille
rähinästä Taanabissa.

296
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,124
Minä sanoin vain
että olet hyvä lentäjä.

297
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,249
En tiennyt, että
he kaipasivat johtajaa.

298
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,961
Ihme ettei sinua pyydetty.
- Kuka sanoo, ettei?

299
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,249
En ole hullu. Ja sinähän
olet se vastuuntuntoinen.

300
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,524
Keisari teki pahan virheen.
Nyt on tullut aika hyökätä.

301
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:17,447
Tiedämme uuden taistelu-
aseman tarkan sijainnin.

302
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,764
Tiedämme myös, ettei sen
asejärjestelmä toimi vielä.

303
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:26,482
Ja koska lähes kaikki
hävittäjät etsivät meitä, -

304
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,483
taisteluasema on
vailla riittävää suojaa.

305
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:33,487
Tärkeintä on se,
että keisari on asemalla -

306
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:38,361
seuraamassa
Kuolemantähden valmistumista.

307
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:43,643
Näiden tietojen saaminen
vei monen bothanin hengen.

308
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,529
Amiraali Ackbar.

309
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:52,811
Kuolemantähti kiertää
Endorin metsäkuuta.

310
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:58,364
Vaikka asejärjestelmä ei
olekaan vielä kunnossa, -

311
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,047
Kuolemantähdellä on
vahva puolustusmekanismi.

312
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:09,407
Sitä suojaa Endorin kuussa
tuotettu energiakilpi.

313
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,766
Kilpi on deaktivoitava,
jos aiomme hyökätä.

314
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:24,091
Kun kilpi on poissa, -

315
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:30,202
hävittäjämme yrittävät
tuhota reaktorin.

316
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,089
Kenraali Calrissian
johtaa hyökkäystä.

317
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,491
Onnea vaan.

318
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,082
Sitä sinä tarvitset.

319
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,924
Kenraali Madine.

320
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,890
Olemme varastaneet
sukkulan Imperiumilta.

321
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,204
Se voi laskeutua kuuhun
Imperiumin koodin avulla.

322
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,681
Se vie joukkoja kuuhun.

323
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,127
He tuhoavat generaattorin
ja energiakilpi katoaa.

324
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,526
Kuulostaa vaaralliselta.

325
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,921
Kenet he ovat saaneet
suostumaan siihen?

326
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,129
Kenraali Solo,
onko iskuryhmänne valmiina?

327
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,168
On, mutta en ole vielä
saanut miehistöä sukkulaan.

328
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,368
Se on kova paikka.

329
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,810
Siinä on yksi.
- Kenraali, minä tulen myös.

330
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,848
Ja minä.

331
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,490
Mitä nyt?
- Kysy toiste.

332
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,806
Minä tuskin käyttäisin
sanaa jännittävä.

333
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:55,127
Minä haluan,
että sinä otat sen.

334
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:01,128
Falcon on nopein alus.
- Hyvä on, vanha kamu.

335
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,248
Tiedän, miten
tärkeä se on sinulle.

336
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:07,086
Pidän huolta siitä.
En naarmuta sitä

337
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:23,001
Muista, ei naarmuakaan.
- Ala jo painua!

338
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,524
Onnea.
- Sitä samaa.

339
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,602
Onko se jo lämmin?
- Kohta.

340
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,926
Imperiumi ei suunnitellut
tätä Wookien ohjattavaksi.

341
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,162
Oletko hereillä?

342
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,767
Olen. Tuli vain sellainen
tunne, etten näe sitä enää.

343
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,286
Mennään nyt, kenraali.

344
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,728
Katsotaan mihin
tästä romukasasta on.

345
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,087
Valmista?

346
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,449
Taas mentiin.

347
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,328
Pitäkää kiinni.

348
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,171
Mikä on käskynne, herra?

349
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,607
Lähetä laivasto Endorin taakse.

350
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:59,162
Se saa odottaa siellä,
kunnes sitä tarvitaan.

351
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,565
Entä raportit kapinallisten
laivueesta Sullustin luona?

352
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,722
Sillä ei ole merkitystä.

353
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,764
Heidät kukistetaan ja
Skywalker liittyy meihin.

354
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,683
Työsi täällä on tehty.

355
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,491
Mene komentoalukseen
odottamaan käskyjäni.

356
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,329
Jos he eivät mene halpaan,
meidän on häivyttävä äkkiä.

357
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,211
Olette monitoreissamme.
Ilmoittautukaa.

358
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,566
Tydirium pyytää lupaa
päästä suojakilven läpi.

359
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,330
Tydirium, ilmoittakaa koodinne.

360
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,125
Tässä ne tulevat.

361
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,249
Kohta näemme miten käy.

362
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,567
Hyvin meidän käy.

363
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,087
Vader on tuossa aluksessa.

364
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:14,410
Älä nyt hermostu.
Se ei ole ainoa komentoalus.

365
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,081
Pysytään etäällä,
mutta yritetään olla luontevia.

366
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,760
En minä tiedä.
Lennä normaalisti.

367
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,923
Minne tuo sukkula menee?

368
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,081
Ilmoittakaa rahtinne
ja päämääränne.

369
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,122
Viemme varaosia ja
miehistöä metsäkuuhun.

370
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,965
Tunsivatko he koodin?

371
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:47,089
Se oli vanha koodi,
mutta aioin hyväksyä sen.

372
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:54,201
Vaarannan tehtävän.
Oli virhe tulla.

373
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:59,491
Älä kuvittele liikoja.
Ollaan optimistisia.

374
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:13,044
Pysäytänkö heidät?
- Ei, minä hoidan heidät.

375
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,601
Kuten haluatte.

376
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,283
Ei mennyt läpi.

377
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:33,170
Tydirium, voitte tulla.
Pitäkääsama suunta.

378
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,131
Tiesin, että
he menevät helppoon.

379
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,522
Minähän sanoin,
että täällä on vaarallista.

380
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,402
Kierrämmekö?
- Se veisi liikaa aikaa.

381
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,529
He eivät saa nähdä meitä.

382
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,687
Chewie ja minä hoidamme heidät.

383
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,445
Tehkää se siististi.
Heitä voi olla enemmänkin.

384
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,370
Epäiletkö minua?

385
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,601
Hae lisävoimia!
- Mentiin.

386
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,122
Tuolla on vielä kaksi.

387
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,487
Näin ne. Odota, Leia!

388
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,810
Odottakaa!

389
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,606
Häiritse niiden lähetintä.

390
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,810
Lähemmäs!

391
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,725
Ohjaa tuon rinnalle.

392
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,242
Pysy tuon perässä,
minä hoidan nuo kaksi.

393
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,963
Kenraali Solo, joku tulee.

394
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,446
Missä Leia on?

395
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,686
Eikö hän ole palannut?
- Hän lähti sinun kanssasi.

396
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,326
Eksyimme toisistamme.
Mennään etsimään häntä.

397
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,483
Tavataan generaattorin
luona kello 03:00.

398
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,688
R2, tarvitsemme skanneriasi.

399
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,565
Ei huolta, Luke-herra,
tiedämme, miten toimia.

400
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,162
Sinä sanoit,
että täällä olisi kaunista.

401
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,888
Lopeta!

402
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,768
En tee pahaa sinulle.

403
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,491
En taida päästä täältä.

404
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,761
Enkä tiedä, missä olen.

405
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,762
Ehkä voit auttaa minua.

406
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,729
Tule tänne istumaan.

407
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,882
Lupaan olla kiltti.

408
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,091
Haluatko syödä jotakin?

409
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,530
Se on hattu.

410
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,602
Ei se tee pahaa.

411
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,727
Oletpa sinä hermostunut.

412
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,564
Mitä nyt?

413
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,531
Liikkumatta!

414
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:37,010
Hae kiituri ja
vie hänet tukikohtaan.

415
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,046
Mitä ihm...

416
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,651
Lähdetään täältä.

417
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,524
Minähän käskin odottaa
komentoaluksessa.

418
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:53,961
Pieni kapinallisryhmä
on laskeutunut Endoriin.

419
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,284
Tiedän.

420
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:01,001
Poikanikin on siellä.

421
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:07,328
Oletko varma?
- Tunnen hänen läsnäolonsa.

422
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,291
Outoa, etten minä ole.

423
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:18,085
Ovatkohan tunteesi selkeät?

424
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,970
Ovat, herrani.

425
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:25,329
Mene sitten odottamaan häntä.

426
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,483
Tuleeko hän luokseni?

427
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:33,047
Olen nähnyt sen ennalta.

428
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:37,250
Hänen tunteensa sinua
kohtaan tuhoaa hänet.

429
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:41,291
Hän tulee luoksesi ja
sinä tuot hänet minulle.

430
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,604
Kuten haluatte.

431
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,050
Tuolla on vielä kaksi
hajonnutta kiituria.

432
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,122
Löysin tämän.

433
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,963
R2 ei löydä
mitään merkkiä hänestä.

434
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:25,010
Toivottavasti hän on kunnossa.

435
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,160
Mitä, Chewie?

436
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,643
Mitä, Chewie?

437
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:52,682
En tajua. Se on kuollut eläin.

438
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:55,408
Älä koske!

439
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,365
Hyvä homma.

440
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:07,210
Hienoa, Chewie, ajattelet
aina vain vatsaasi.

441
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:12,320
Yritetään päästä tästä.
Yletytkö valomiekkaani?

442
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,491
R2, tuo ei vaikuta
kovinkaan järkevältä.

443
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,642
Olemme aika korkealla.

444
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,450
Älä osoittele sillä.

445
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,771
Han, lopeta.

446
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,722
Anna heille varsijousesi.

447
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,164
Voi pääparkaani!

448
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,203
Hyvänen aika!

449
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,928
Ymmärrätkö heitä?

450
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,403
Kyllä. Minähän osaan
kuutta miljoonaa kieltä.

451
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,209
Mitä sanoit heille?

452
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,448
Terve, luultavasti.

453
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:28,324
He puhuvat outoa murretta
ja pitävät minua jumalana.

454
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:37,082
Käytä jumalaista valtaasi
ja hommaa meidät vapaaksi.

455
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:42,485
Se ei olisi sopivaa.
- Sopivaa?

456
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:46,610
En saa esiintyä jumalana.
- Sinä senkin...

457
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:59,721
Minä erehdyin.
Me olemme ystäviä.

458
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:48,166
Minulla on pahat aavistukset.

459
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,770
Mitä hän sanoi?

460
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:16,847
Tämä on noloa, mutta
olet pääruoka juhlassani.

461
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:31,007
Leia!

462
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,766
Teidän kuninkaallinen
korkeutenne...

463
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,683
Nämä ovat ystäviäni.

464
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:45,969
3 PO, sano että
heidät on vapautettava.

465
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,923
Jotenkin tuntuu siltä,
ettei se auttanut.

466
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,127
Sano, että sinä suutut
jos he eivät tottele -

467
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,043
ja käytät taikavoimiasi.

468
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,521
Mitä taikavoimia?

469
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,204
Sano se vain heille.

470
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:36,926
He eivät uskoneet.
Minähän sanoin.

471
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,687
Päästäkää alas!

472
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,130
Luojan kiitos.

473
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,124
Kiitos, 3 PO.

474
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:51,805
En tiennytkään,
että osaan sellaista.

475
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:05,200
Prinsessa Leia...

476
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:08,810
Darth Vader...

477
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,684
Kuolemantähti...

478
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,961
Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

479
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,448
Olen tulossa siihen.

480
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:30,887
Luke-herra...

481
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:41,206
Millennium Falcon...
Cloud City.

482
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:44,926
Vader...

483
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:50,847
Han Solo jäässä.

484
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:18,170
Mitä nyt?
- En tiedä.

485
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,611
Loistavaa, kuulumme
nyt heidän heimoonsa.

486
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,923
Sitä olen aina halunnut.

487
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:52,047
Parempi lyhytkin apu
kuin ei apua ollenkaan.

488
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,843
Tiedustelijat vievät
meidät generaattorin luo.

489
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:04,686
Miten kaukana se on? Kysy.

490
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:08,047
Tarvitsemme muonaa.

491
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:10,126
Yritä saada aseemme.

492
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,761
Vauhtia.
Ei ole koko päivää aikaa.

493
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:18,163
Mikä hätänä, Luke?

494
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:25,729
Muistatko äitisi?
Oikean äitisi?

495
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:29,327
Hämärästi.
Hän kuoli ollessani vielä pieni.

496
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:34,088
Mitä muistat hänestä?
- Joitakin kuvia.

497
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:35,810
Kerro.

498
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:40,563
Hän oli kaunis.

499
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,325
Kiltti mutta surullinen.

500
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:48,284
Miksi kysyt?

501
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:53,924
Minä en muista äitiäni.
En tavannut häntä koskaan.

502
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,847
Mikä sinua vaivaa?

503
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:06,611
Vader on täällä.
Hän on tällä kuulla.

504
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:11,960
Mistä tiedät?
- Tunnen hänen läsnäolonsa.

505
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,248
Hän tuli hakemaan minua.
Hän tuntee läsnäoloni.

506
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:21,850
Minun on lähdettävä.
Vaarannan tehtävämme.

507
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,844
Minun pitää kohdata hänet.
- Miksi?

508
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,723
Hän on isäni.

509
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:38,324
Isäsi?

510
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:43,610
Eikä siinä kaikki.
Tämä on vaikea asia.

511
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:46,570
Ellen palaa takaisin,
sinä olet ainoa toivo.

512
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,210
Älä puhu tuollaisia.

513
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:52,842
Sinulla on Voima.
Minulla ei ole mitään.

514
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:56,925
Olet väärässä, Leia.
Sinullakin on se.

515
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,368
Aikanaan opit käyttämään
sitä niin kuin minäkin.

516
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,281
Voima on vahva suvussani.

517
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:14,005
Isälläni on se. Minulla on.

518
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:19,166
Ja sisarellani.

519
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:28,563
Olet siskoni, Leia.

520
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,450
Tiedän sen.

521
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:43,201
Jotenkin minä
olen aina tiennyt sen.

522
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:45,282
Sitten tiedät, että minun
on kohdattava hänet.

523
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,846
Ei. Pakene, Luke.

524
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:53,322
Jos hän tuntee
läsnäolosi, lähde pois.

525
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:58,770
Kunpa voisin lähteä kanssasi.
- Ei. Sinä olet vahva.

526
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:02,361
Miksi sinun sitten
on kohdattava hänet?

527
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:06,206
Koska hänessä on hyvää.
Olen tuntenut sen.

528
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,089
Hän ei luovuta minua
keisarille.

529
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:11,562
Voin pelastaa
hänet hyvälle puolelle.

530
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,803
Minun on yritettävä.

531
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,248
Mitä täällä tapahtuu?

532
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,328
Ei mitään.
Halusin vain olla hetken yksin.

533
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:43,324
Vai ei mitään?

534
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,048
Kerro nyt.

535
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:54,367
En voi kertoa sinulle.

536
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,645
Mutta Lukelle voit?

537
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,124
Anteeksi.

538
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,444
Ota minut syliin.

539
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,723
Tämä kapinallinen
antautui meille.

540
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:24,603
Heitä voi olla enemmänkin,
joten alue olisi tutkittava.

541
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:28,371
Hänellä oli vain tämä ase.

542
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,084
Hyvää työtä.

543
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:37,929
Jatkakaa etsintöjä ja tuokaa
hänen kumppaninsa minulle.

544
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:45,127
Keisari on odottanut sinua.

545
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:47,965
Tiedän, isä.

546
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,761
Olet siis hyväksynyt totuuden?

547
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:56,407
Olen sen, että sinä olet
isäni, Anakin Skywalker.

548
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:59,802
Sillä nimellä ei ole
enää mitään merkitystä.

549
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:03,290
Se on tosi nimesi.
Olet vain unohtanut sen.

550
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:08,489
Sinussa on hyvää.
Keisari ei ole hävittänyt kaikkea.

551
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:18,248
Siksi et voinut tuhota minua,
siksi et vie minua keisarille.

552
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:28,523
Olet rakentanut uuden miekan.

553
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:35,124
Olet oppinut kaiken.

554
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:44,968
Olet todella voimakas,
kuten keisari on nähnyt.

555
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,683
Tule kanssani.

556
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:56,604
Obi-Wan ajatteli
kerran samoin kuin sinä.

557
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:02,687
Et tiedä, miten vahva
Voima on pimeällä puolella.

558
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,570
Minun on toteltava herraani.

559
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:10,082
En vaihda puolta,
joten sinun on tapettava minut.

560
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:14,045
Jos se on kohtalosi.

561
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:17,966
Tutki tunteitasi, isä.
Et voi tehdä sitä.

562
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,691
Sinussa kuohuu.
Voit päästä eroon vihastasi.

563
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:25,367
Se on liian myöhäistä minulle.

564
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:32,922
Keisari näyttää Voiman
todellisen luonteen.

565
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,721
Hän on nyt herrasi.

566
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:43,126
Silloin isäni
on todellakin kuollut.

567
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:30,244
Bunkkerin sisäänkäynti
on toisella puolella.

568
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,686
Tästä ei tule helppoa.
- Älä ole huolissasi.

569
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:37,969
Olemme menneet
pahempiinkin paikkoihin.

570
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:47,924
Mitä hän sanoi?

571
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,129
Harjun toisella puolella
on salainen sisäänkäynti.

572
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:13,962
Amiraali, olemme perillä.

573
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,802
Aloittakaa laskenta.

574
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,480
Koordinaatit valmiiksi.

575
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:28,482
Ole huoleti.
Ystäväni hoitavat kilven pois.

576
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,971
Tai tästä tulee kaikkien
aikojen lyhin hyökkäys.

577
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:39,646
Valmiina loikkaamaan
hyperavaruuteen.

578
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:41,722
Selvä. Valmiina.

579
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,442
Takaoviko? Hyvä ajatus.

580
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:14,849
Vain pari vartijaa.
Helppo nakki.

581
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,810
Yksikin riittää hälyttämään.

582
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,451
Tehdään se sitten äänettömästi.

583
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:28,046
Prinsessa Leia!

584
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:33,445
Ystävämme taitaa tehdä
jotakin hätiköityä.

585
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,363
Voi ei!

586
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,882
Yllätyshyökkäys
ei enää onnistu.

587
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:50,447
Pysäyttäkää se!

588
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:05,409
Ei hullumpaa karvapallolta.
Vain yksi jäljellä.

589
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:07,960
Pysy sinä tässä,
me hoidamme hänet.

590
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:12,327
Olen päättänyt,
että me pysymme tässä.

591
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:50,124
Tervetuloa, nuori Skywalker.

592
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,567
Olen odottanut sinua.

593
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:55,562
Et tarvitse enää noita.

594
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,923
Vartijat, poistukaa.

595
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:13,807
Odotan kovasti, että saan
koulutuksesi päätökseen.

596
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:19,011
Aikanaan sinä
kutsut minua herraksesi.

597
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:23,847
Erehdyt. Minua et käännytä
kuten käännytit isäni.

598
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:28,490
Väärin, nuori jedi.

599
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:40,242
Huomaat, että olet itse
erehtynyt monessa asiassa.

600
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,604
Hänen valomiekkansa.

601
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:47,366
Jedin ase.

602
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:50,600
Isäsi aseen kaltainen.

603
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:52,045
Tiedätkin jo, -

604
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:55,522
ettei isäsi voi koskaan
palata pimeältä puolelta.

605
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:58,490
Samoin käy sinullekin.

606
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,642
Olet väärässä.

607
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:03,849
Olen pian kuollut
ja niin olet sinäkin.

608
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:11,604
Viittaatko kapinallisten
hyökkäysaikeisiin?

609
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:19,126
Olemme turvassa heiltä.

610
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:23,164
Varmuutesi on heikkoutesi.

611
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:26,403
Ja sinun heikkoutesi
on luottamus ystäviisi.

612
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:32,561
Turha vastustella.

613
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:42,044
Kaikki tapahtunut on
tapahtunut tahtoni mukaan.

614
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:47,530
Kuussa olevat ystäväsi
ovat kävelemässä ansaan.

615
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,841
Samoin kapinallislaivasto.

616
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:57,841
Välitin heille itse
tiedon generaattorista.

617
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:02,005
Se on turvassa surkealta
iskuryhmältänne.

618
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:06,369
Legioonani parhaat
sotilaat odottavat heitä.

619
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:17,965
Kilpi on kunnossa
ystäviesi saapuessa.

620
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:24,484
Ylös. Sivulle.

621
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:26,050
Nopeasti!

622
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:34,206
Pian, laivasto saapuu
minä hetkenä hyvänsä.

623
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:38,201
Anna räjähteet!

624
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,163
He jäävät kiinni!

625
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,724
Tule takaisin!

626
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:51,049
R2, älä mene.

627
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,729
Liikkumatta!

628
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,002
Senkin roskaväki!

629
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:22,087
Ilmoittautukaa.
- Punainen johtaja valmiina.

630
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:25,403
Harmaa johtaja valmiina.
- Vihreä valmiina.

631
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:28,362
Hyökkäysvalmiuteen.

632
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,162
Olkoon Voima kanssamme.

633
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:40,769
Eikö kilvestä saa tietoja?

634
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:47,725
Miten ihmeessä,
jos he eivät tiedä tulostamme?

635
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:51,361
Keskeyttäkää hyökkäys!
Kilpi on yhä päällä.

636
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,568
En saa tietoja siitä.
Oletko varma?

637
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:55,881
Kaikki takaisin.

638
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:04,325
Vihreä ryhmä, pysykää
sektorissa MV-7.

639
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:08,930
Amiraali, sektorissa
37 on vihollisaluksia.

640
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,604
Tämä oli ansa!

641
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:16,082
Hävittäjiä tulossa.

642
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:20,931
Niitä on liian paljon.

643
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:27,607
Lisätkää nopeuttanne. Vetäkää
hävittäjät pois risteilijän luota.

644
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:36,529
Tule katsomaan, poika.

645
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:48,365
Näet liittoutuneiden ja
turhan kapinanne lopun.

646
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:58,640
Haluat tämän, vai mitä?

647
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:03,282
Vihasi valtaa sinut.

648
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:10,201
Ota jedin ase ja käytä sitä.
Minä olen aseeton.

649
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:12,203
Iske minut maahan sillä.

650
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:14,851
Anna periksi vihallesi.

651
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:21,051
Hetki hetkeltä tulet
enemmän palvelijakseni.

652
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:29,642
Sitä ei voi välttää.

653
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:32,881
Se on kohtalosi.

654
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:37,043
Sinä, kuten isäsikin, -

655
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:39,600
olette nyt...

656
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,330
minun!

657
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,841
Liikettä!

658
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:14,567
Hei siellä!
Minuako te etsitte?

659
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:17,962
Tuokaa nuo tänne.

660
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:29,884
Ne tulevat nyt.
Oliko tämä nyt hyvä ajatus?

661
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:32,611
Liikkumatta.

662
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,648
Me antaudumme.

663
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:42,203
Koodia on muutettu.

664
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:44,681
Tarvitsemme R2:ta.

665
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:48,924
R2, missä olet?
Tule bunkkerin suulle.

666
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:52,530
Minne muka menet?

667
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:55,844
Minne, R2?

668
01:39:55,920 --> 01:40:01,962
Nyt ei ole aika
leikkiä sankaria.

669
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:30,003
Pidä varasi, Wedge,
Kolme yläpuolellasi.

670
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:33,084
Punainen kolme ja kaksi,
lähemmäksi. - Selvä.

671
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:38,049
Kolme tulossa, 20 astetta.

672
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:39,929
Minä hoidan johtajan.

673
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:49,969
Ne ovat menossa
sairaalafregattia kohti.

674
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:08,642
Pelkkiä hävittäjiä.
Missä tähtihävittäjät ovat?

675
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:15,004
Olemme valmiit.

676
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:18,289
Odotetaan.
- Emmekö iske?

677
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:21,728
Keisarilla on muita suunnitelmia.

678
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:23,802
Mutta pakoon emme heitä päästä.

679
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:29,564
Kuten näet, oppipoikani, -

680
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:32,883
ystäväsi epäonnistuivat.

681
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:41,565
Nyt saat nähdä,
miten suuri tulivoima tällä on.

682
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:45,286
Ampukaa.

683
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:54,004
Tulta!

684
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:03,211
Se tuli Kuolemantähdestä!

685
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:06,447
Sen ase on toimintavalmis.

686
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:10,650
Täällä kultainen johtaja.
- Vetäytykää.

687
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:12,961
Emme ehkä saa koskaan
toista tilaisuutta.

688
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:15,850
Heillä on ylivoima.

689
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:19,242
Emme mahda mitään.

690
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:23,046
Meidän on annettava
Hanille lisää aikaa.

691
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:55,770
Vauhtia, R2.

692
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:10,728
Miksi sinun
piti olla niin urhea?

693
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:16,526
Ehkä saan sen auki
tekemällä oikosulun.

694
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:18,125
Minä suojaan.

695
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:05,010
Yritä päästä niin lähelle,
ettei se voi ampua meitä.

696
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:08,527
Emme pärjää
siellä tähtihävittäjille.

697
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:11,285
Kuolemantähti on tuhottava.

698
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:13,681
Samalla voimme viedä
niistä pari mukanamme.

699
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:17,971
Se räjähtää!

700
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:23,644
Minuun osui!

701
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:35,126
Laivastonne on tuhottu,
ja ystäväsi kuolleet.

702
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:42,571
Pakotietä ei ole,
nuori oppipoikani.

703
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:51,968
Liittoutuma tuhoutuu,
samoin kuin ystäväsi.

704
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:56,885
Hyvä.

705
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:01,128
Tunnen vihasi.

706
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:06,401
Olen puolustuskyvytön.
Ota aseesi.

707
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:09,643
Iske minua vihallasi -

708
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:14,282
ja matkasi pimeän
puolelle on alkanut.

709
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:55,602
Katso!
- Heitä se alas.

710
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:50,768
Taisin onnistua.

711
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:52,171
Se onnistui!

712
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:02,722
Prinsessa Leia, osuiko pahasti?
- Pikkujuttu.

713
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:04,211
Liikkumatta!

714
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:12,965
Rakastan sinua.
- Tiedän.

715
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:14,405
Kädet ylös.

716
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:28,050
Älkää liikkuko.

717
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:35,329
Chewie!

718
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:40,642
Tule, hän on haavoittunut.
Ei, odota!

719
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:42,370
Minä keksin.

720
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,170
Hyvä.

721
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:59,086
Käytä aggressioitasi.

722
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:01,970
Anna vihan vallata sinut.

723
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:11,167
Obi-Wan on
opettanut sinua hyvin.

724
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:17,001
En taistele sinua vastaan.

725
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:33,970
Ei ole viisasta
laskea suojaustaan.

726
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:01,280
Näen ajatuksiisi.

727
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:04,523
Tunnen sinussa hyvyyttä.
Kamppailet sisimmässäsi.

728
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:07,171
En kamppaile.

729
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:13,525
Et voi tappaa minua.

730
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:18,208
Aliarvioit
pimeän puolen Voiman.

731
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:22,888
Taistele tai tapaat kohtalosi.

732
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:49,406
Laivue lähestyy.
- Minä hoidan sen.

733
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:52,725
Hyvä osuma!

734
01:50:56,320 --> 01:51:01,247
Olemme kaiken keskellä.
Han, älä jätä minua pulaan.

735
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:09,731
Kapinalliset on lyöty.
He pakenevat metsään.

736
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:12,371
Lähettäkää vahvistuksia
takaa-ajoon.

737
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:17,530
Kolme joukkuetta apuun.
Avatkaa takaovi.

738
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:33,130
Anna toinen pakkaus.

739
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:53,450
Et voi piileksiä ikuisesti.

740
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:56,648
En taistele sinua vastaan.

741
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:08,807
Antaudu pimeälle puolelle. Vain
siten voit pelastaa ystäväsi.

742
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:13,646
Niin, näen ajatuksiisi.

743
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:16,326
Rakastat heitä syvästi.

744
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:18,323
Ennen kaikkea...

745
01:52:20,440 --> 01:52:22,169
sisartasi.

746
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:27,763
Sinulla on kaksoissisar.

747
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:31,561
Tunteesi paljastivat
hänet minulle.

748
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:35,810
Obi-Wan oli viisas,
kun piilotti hänet minulta.

749
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:40,329
Nyt hänen tappiostaan
tulee täydellinen.

750
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:48,530
Ellet sinä tule pimeälle
puolelle, siskosi ehkä tulee.

751
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:49,567
Ei ikinä!

752
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:36,889
Hyvä.

753
01:53:41,200 --> 01:53:43,965
Vihasi antoi sinulle voimia.

754
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:54,325
Täytä nyt kohtalosi ja
ota isäsi paikka rinnallani.

755
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:10,725
En koskaan.

756
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:15,927
En tule koskaan
pimeälle puolelle.

757
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:21,730
Epäonnistuit.

758
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:26,010
Olen jedi kuten isäni
ennen minua.

759
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:37,047
Olkoon sitten niin, jedi.

760
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:39,129
Juoskaa!

761
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:55,645
Kilpi on poissa!
Iskekää reaktoriin.

762
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:59,520
Olemme jo matkalla.
Seuratkaa minua.

763
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:01,602
Mitä minä sanoin!

764
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:14,841
Ellei sinua voi
käännyttää, tuhoan sinut.

765
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:23,570
Nuori houkka.

766
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:29,322
Vasta nyt loppusi
tullessa tajuat.

767
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:48,368
Tajuat että voimasi eivät riitä
pimeän puolen Voimalle.

768
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:56,045
Nyt maksat tyhmyydestäsi.

769
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:03,409
Isä, auta.

770
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:24,847
Nyt, nuori Skywalker,
nyt sinä kuolet.

771
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:52,402
Ei.

772
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:56,761
Ei!

773
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:49,085
Isken reaktoriin.

774
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:53,486
Nyt tai ei koskaan.

775
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:04,451
Lukitse voimakkaimpaan
energialähteeseen.

776
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:10,127
Muotoon.
Tarkkana, täällä on ahdasta.

777
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:31,090
Hajaantukaa ja yrittäkää
houkutella se peräänne.

778
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:44,050
Se oli jo liian lähellä.

779
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,207
Meidän on annettava
hävittäjille lisää aikaa.

780
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:53,363
Keskittäkää kaikki tuli
Supertähtihävittäjään.

781
01:58:59,480 --> 01:59:01,642
Suojakilpi on poissa.

782
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:04,769
Ketään ei saa päästää läpi.

783
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:09,049
Lisätkää tulitehoa!

784
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:12,723
Liian myöhäistä!

785
01:59:55,640 --> 02:00:01,044
Luke, auta minua
riisumaan tämä naamio.

786
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:03,043
Mutta silloin sinä kuolet.

787
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:07,407
Kuolen joka tapauksessa.

788
02:00:08,440 --> 02:00:16,291
Anna minun nähdä
poikani omilla silmilläni.

789
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:56,963
Mene nyt, poikani.

790
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:00,045
Jätä minut.

791
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:03,606
Ei, otan sinut mukaani.

792
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:06,047
Minä pelastan sinut.

793
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:10,680
Olet jo pelastanut.

794
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:16,800
Olit oikeassa minun suhteeni.

795
02:01:18,680 --> 02:01:23,766
Kerro siskollesi,
että sinä olit oikeassa.

796
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:32,001
Isä...

797
02:01:36,240 --> 02:01:37,685
En jätä sinua.

798
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:04,087
Siinä se on!

799
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,401
Iske tehonsäätimiin!

800
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:12,848
Olen jo menossa.

801
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:35,243
Laivasto pois
Kuolemantähden läheisyydestä.

802
02:03:22,360 --> 02:03:24,124
He tekivät sen!

803
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:35,006
Luke ei takuulla ollut
siellä sen räjähtäessä.

804
02:03:36,640 --> 02:03:38,529
Olet oikeassa.

805
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:40,324
Tunnen sen.

806
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:46,644
Rakastat häntä.

807
02:03:49,960 --> 02:03:51,450
Etkö rakastakin?

808
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:53,010
Kyllä.

809
02:03:53,080 --> 02:03:55,845
Hyvä on, minä ymmärrän.

810
02:03:58,360 --> 02:04:03,002
En aio asettua tiellenne.

811
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:07,682
Käsitit ihan väärin.

812
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:13,727
Hän on veljeni.

813
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:56,964
Olemme vapaita!
