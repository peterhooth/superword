Workers update statistics on URLs by incrementing counters in Cassandra.
Use mod/hashing to make sure same URL always goes to same worker.
Spouts and bolts execute as many tasks across the cluster.
When a tuple is emitted, which task does it go to?
Define a spout in the topology with parallelism of 5 tasks.
Consumer decides what data it receives and how it gets grouped.
Reach is the number of unique people exposed to a URL on Twitter.
Keep set of followers for each request id in memory.
A spout tuple is not fully processed until all tuples in the tree have been completed.
If the tuple tree is not completed within a specified timeout, the spout tuple is replayed.
Storm tracks tuple trees for you in an extremely efficient way.
How do you do idempotent counting with an at least once delivery guarantee?
Built completely on top of Storm’s primitives of streams, spouts, and bolts.
If there’s a failure during commit, the whole batch + commit is retried.
Multiple batches can be processed in parallel, but commits are guaranteed to be ordered.
Requires a more sophisticated source queue than Kestrel or RabbitMQ.
TransactionalSpout is a subtopology consisting of a spout and a bolt.
The spout consists of one task that coordinates the transactions.
The coordinator emits a “batch” stream and a “commit stream”
Coordinator reuses tuple tree framework to detect success or failure of batches or commits and replays.
