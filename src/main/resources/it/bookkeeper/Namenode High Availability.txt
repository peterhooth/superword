However, BNN based solution did not address double failure scenario.
NN1 failed to stream edits to the Backup node and removed the stream.
Store the edit logs at a common place and share to both the Namenodes.
Both NameNodes start as standby and try loading the edits.
New process FailOver Controller (ZKFC) responsible for monitoring and failover.
On ZK based leader election ZKFC issue command to its local NN to become Active or Standby.
Only Active NN will write to shared storage, Standby NN will read from it.
All DataNodes will send block reports to both Namenodes to achieve hot Standby.
NFS:  May not be a better fit for many deployments as NFS is an external device, costly, less control on timeouts etc.
It did not come out from any of the Apache releases yet.
Parallel writes to write-quorum Bookies and wait for ack-quorum (see BOOKKEEPER-208)
BookKeeper is in production use at Yahoo! for guaranteed delivery of log messages to Hedwig Servers.
Code was there for more than a year in Apache and has active contributors and committers list.
BookKeeper Journal Manager (BKJM) is NameNode plugin implementation, involves BK client to read/write to/from BK cluster.
Importance – To avoid the data-loss when multiple Bookie crashes.
Entry read latency improvement with (round-robin + speculative) reads with less.
Verified the fault tolerant tests with BK recovery feature – see the.
Periodic kill node scenarios to verify the switch with BK – Did not.
In our test cluster, we did not see  significant degradations and.
